This page is more of a personal "map" for me to take note and revisit tools that I sometimes need to reinstall in new machines I use for work (both at home or in the workplace). It usually helps me quickly setup and prepare for new [monster projects](https://raid-software-testing.com/) when I'm in [Tester-Commando mode](https://raid-software-testing.com/).

Feel free to have a look! Or also [suggest something new](https://github.com/filfreire/filfreire.github.io).
