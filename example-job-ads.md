## Intro

I've created these job descriptions for some roles I was interviewing and hiring for in early 2020, in order to try and "catch" a specific type of Tester, deeply in line with the values I'd search for a ["Commando" Tester](https://filfreire.com/posts/asymmetric_warfare) and/or a [Test Jumper](https://filfreire.com/posts/asymmetric_warfare).

The industy is mostly filled with vain/shallow job descriptions when it comes to sourcing for Testers and Testing Experts, and oftentimes it takes the job descriptions from the same pile of goo: from the cheerleading community "_we need someone positive, friendly, to tell us everything is ok and assured_" onwards to the default "_standardized QA to assure quality, zombie eats brains_" community.

I'll update this post through time, and it serves me as a quick reference guide for any new positions I'm working as a hiring manager. Feel free to adapt it or reuse it or send me questions about it through my <a href="https://keybase.io/filfreireadidas">keybase</a> or <a href="https://t.me/filfreire">telegram</a>.

## Advice

Make it apparent (or implicit) on the description that you know the lingo:
- There's no such thing as "Automated Testing", since Testing is a human complex activity cannot be automated, but logical checks (commonly known as unit, integration, sanity, ... "tests") can be automated and put into scripts;
- No dumb/shallow references to "we need someone to assure our quality", "someone strong at QA processes". If you need someone that knows how to setup CI pipelines for automated checks, state it. If you need someone who will be trying to extract some metrics related to Testing state it. If you need someone who will provide you with detailed Evidence of testing (because maybe you're insecure), also state it in the job description. It's better to be bold and straight to the point, even if for reasons that will paint you as "imperfect", that to be shallow and vain.
