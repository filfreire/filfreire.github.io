- I helped to host [Porto Testers Meetup #2.1](https://www.eventbrite.pt/e/bilhetes-porto-testers-meetup-21-37305787615).
- I helped Pedro Tavares ([@ordepdev](https://twitter.com/ordepdev)) to start the first portuguese chapter of "Papers we love" meetup, ([Papers we love @Porto](https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Porto/)). I haven't been involved since the first editions, but feel free to ping [Pedro](https://twitter.com/ordepdev) up if you'd like to give a talk, and be on the lookout for next editions of the meetup;
