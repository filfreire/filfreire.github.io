There's an evil that found it's home in a lot of tech companies, both big and small, from startups to old corporations: quality infotainment.


Quality infotainment is probably the most popular and simple form of sabotage of software projects from the Testing (and Quality) perspectives. 

In its core form it's as simple as this: the production and maintenance of any irrelevant information, processesand efforts that are the direct antithesis (opposite) of meaningful testing efforts.

## How do I spot if my project is infected with this evil?

- You'll notice that crude/raw data counts of test cases, bugs found, bugs fixed, automated checks coverage percentages are escalated to leadership, be it first level management or close-to-board leaders, often shown as boy/girl scouts badges or participation medals;
- Dubious decisions are made on the premise of "improving visibility of X for business/product folks"
- You'll notice technical people using terms like "We need to assure our quality"; "We're taking these steps to improve our quality assurance"; "We measure quality by counting the <insert type of bean or vegetable here>"
- Massive automated check dasboard and table "centralization" efforts are made so "product people can have more visibility";
- Words of order reign over facts and logic: "More Visibility!"; "Improvement!"; "Assuring!"; "Measuring Quality!";
- Initiatives that brew "quality/testing" documents, some extensive and some over-simplifying, punctuated by lengthy meetings, detailed lorem-ipsum powerpoints, and some meetings to follow-up other meetings.
- "Our testers spend so much time on manual testing, we need more automation"
- "Our test pipelines take hours to run, we need to revamp them and use a standard toolset"


## How do I get rid of this evil?

- ignore that it exists
- or
- do something about it


## Organized guerrilla efforts Vs. Hippy/Savage disorganization and sabotage
