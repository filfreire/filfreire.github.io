(early draft)

Hello there! This is the fifth post of my "[Gamers and Testers](https://gamersandtesters.com/)" series. In these posts I ask a guest a series of usual (and unusual) questions about their experience of being involved with software testing in the videogames industry.

My guest for this post is [Harvey Newman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harveynewman/). Harvey is currently Gameplay Animation Director with [Build a Rocket Boy](TODO), working on an undisclosed AAA open-world project/game. Before that he worked as Lead Animator with [DICE](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dice-ea/) on very known titles like [Star Wars Battlefront 2](TODO) and [Battlefield V](TODO), and in other companies had the change to work as animator for memorable titles like [Total War: Warhammer](TODO), [Horizon Zero Dawn](TODO), [Fable Legends](TODO),[Crysis 3](TODO), among many others. He's an established Animator in the industry, running also his own [Youtube channel](TODO), being a juror for [BAFTA Game Animation Awards](TODO).

Similarly to many high-demand profiles in the gaming industry, one of the ways he begun his career was working as a software tester in the games industry. As a software tester he was able to test a few key SEGA titles, as well two that were a phenomenon, specially in my origin country (Portugal): Football Manager 2005 and 2006.

### 1. For someone as accomplished as you in the game industry - what was 'THE game' that made you "fall in love" with the games?

/TODO

### 2. Let's take a trip to the past first, what were the ideas you had before starting in the industry, specifically as a tester, that changed (in a good or bad way) upon being inside?

/TODO

### 3. What are some key differences that you spot from your times as a tester back then, and your fellow testers nowadays?

/TODO

### 4. Now as an Animator, what's the interaction like with testing colleagues?

/TODO

### 5. Like most people in the industry, you have to spend your days in front of a screen for hours on end. Are you still able to enjoy games in your off-time?

/TODO

### 6. What was one thing you liked the most and one thing you liked the least over the years, both as Animator, and in the past as a Tester?

/TODO

### 7. In the more "default" software world, there's often a lack of meaningful discussion about the relationship between, say, designers and Testers. What's one thing that you feel is missing when it comes to discussions of Testing and Animation (or Design) in video games?

/TODO

### 8. As a tester I ended up developing a certain "critical/analitical" awareness (sometimes with no off switch), when playing a game or using a piece of software that makes me go "bleh! what a nasty bug!". Do you feel that too from an animation perspective, where you're able to appreciate/criticize things with a different eye than most folks? Can you share some examples?

/TODO

### 9. What advice would you give to friends who are considering joining the industry as a Tester or an Animator?
