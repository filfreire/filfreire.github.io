The problem with senior leadership or normal users on social media finding bugs that supposedly your testers should have found, ask yourself why

I have a few possible explanations:

The senior leadership and normal users are, without putting much thought into it - actually INTERACTING with the end product, in ways a human would. Be it in expected, unexpected, being and malicious ways - actual users do what actual users do - they interact. They inadvertently learn. They experiment.

And meanwhile, maybe, just maybe - your testers are invested in maintaining automated checks, test cases, test documentation, reproducing “test scripts” manually, “testing regressions”, etc etc - always on the same spinning wheel. They have their minds so busy with all this stuff - that at the end they spend on a practical way - less time interacting with the product in a meaningful way - than a user or a senior leader that just decides - "hey I want to do this, lets use the app”

The same happened to me in the past, and rightfully so - at the end developers and others could perfectly say to themselves: but filipe why did you miss this? “Why are you not testing?”

I’m the first to blame - I wasn’t testing because I was doing all this other stuff that wasn’t necessarily testing… it was maintaining automation, test documentation, and maintaining or creating “dummy”/“meaningless” evidence of testing. And one can be awesome and great at doing all of these things - but they are still not a replacement for meaningful testing:
- Meaningful/purposeful interaction with the app
- Learning, asking questions, hunting for confusion and risks
- Experimenting all the way


Have the guts to ask yourself as a tester, or a test manager, or a tech lead, etc: why is it then… that a senior president that invested 5 minutes with the app… is finding stuff that myself or  hundreds of my testers missed?

Maybe myself or my testers are not investing the better slice of their time in stuff that actually matters: testing.

PS: You’ll be surprised - it’s one thing to have someone whose job at the end isn’t “testing” ending up doing testing - and then having someone who is a craftsman tester in your team with the headspace and resources to invest their time testing - because then there’s a difference: it’s a chance at meaningful deep testing that completely smokes the usual “passive approaches” of:
- “I want to maintain tons of test cases"
- “I want to see all my testing evidence in beautiful graphs of percentages and numbers of cases passed and automated"
- “I want to automate testing"


And before you misinterpret the above:
- Testers can spend half of their time coding automated CHECKS - its not bad, it’s a good option.
- We can automate checks, test data generation, deployments, and so many other things - they’re useful and valuable - it’s a good option.
- Using “automation” as an empty word of order to help justify one’s poor test strategy (that involves 0 interaction with product) is the crappy option.

If you hear any of the above - give them the middle finger, or as Seinfeld would recommend, give them the foot toe.
