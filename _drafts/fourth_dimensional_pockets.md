Do I have a problem with people following their own track? Nope. "Whatever works best for their context, they are empowered to do anything provided it will still accomplish their main mission as a tester - hunt down and signal the most important and meaningful bugs and risks about the product in the time they're given".

Valuable contributions are not necessarily "voicing ones concerns while disregarding completely the most important element": the human element.

Context matters and it's different across any team, no matter if the team is part of the same cluster of teams and working for the same "purpose/product", dedicated to a small part of it.

Humans are not pods and can't be spinned up/down for load balancing. When you provide people the clear options, be on guard, because you'll quickly identify who views their team-members as "pods" and who views them as humans, depending on workloads and release "promises".

each team, no matter if sharing the same underlying tools, libraries, code-based - is composed of different unique people, providing different tempos to the whole picture.

A release cycle of a team is not necessarily similar to the team next to it.

Expectations can be similar explicitely, but never implicitly - within the team, within Àùstakeholders", within actual stakeholders, etc.
