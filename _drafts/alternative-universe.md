If you've read my [distopian testing future post](TODO), you could observe a short summary of my probably flawed/biased point of view of the industry.

But, I believe there's another thing that's appearing in the horizon, besides "testing-as-a-service" vendors and sweatshops that I'd like to talk about, and something that I think needs to be raised and discussed, say, before "good or bad things happen". Keep in mind the "labour resource" notion mentioned before.

A few years ago a known (and a bit controversial) programmer, [Yegor](https://yegor256.com), started paving the blocks for a development methodology that, in his words:

> aims to reduce risks and improve quality in a project of almost any size.

The methodology I'm referring to is [Extremely Distributed Software Development](https://www.xdsd.org/XDSD-WhitePaper.pdf). The sort of "to long didn't read" explanation of the methodology is something like:

> picture a documentation-first software project, with hardcore strict code quality, hardcore strict development process rules, every deliverable is specified in a small way, there are no human managers, there almost zero human-human interaction outside of the code repository and ticketing system, no salaries, bugs and defects are non-blocking of releases, every deliverable is so small and unique that any one programmer of a pool of skilled programmers may code and deliver it to production in no more than a few hours and get paid for it in a matter of minutes, ...

My description of it of course falls short of the original descriptions, but from the looks of it, it's a weird methodology right? Beatiful? Scary? Utopian? Crazy? You can read more about it in the link. But for the purposes of this post, I want to focus on why it matters for testers.

Whatever is one's take on it: It's happening right now.

It's inception shouldn't go unnoticed to testers. [Yegor](https://yegor256.com) founded a company called [Zerocracy](TODO) with the major purpose of putting this methodology into practice, providing it as a service. If it does end up succeding as a methodology and a business and spreads and grows bigger in the industry, for sure, whether one see's it as a good or a bad thing: it will have an impact in the testing craft.

I decided to try for myself, and look a bit into the possible impact it may have on the testing craft.

## Experimenting

Here's what I did...

## Initial observations

So how may this impact the testing craft? I see some postive points and some negative points:

Let's start with the positive:

- TODO

Now for the negative:

- TODO


## Wrapping up

Presumably, by reading the testimonials page, it's signaled that there are already some people with money and projects and businesses that are picking up on it, and using it. And guess by the positive testimonials some of them notice the four advertised things on [Zerocracy]()'s webpage:

- Reduced labor costs;
- Not having to deal with personnel turnover;
- High maintainability of the projects, because of the communication restrictions;
- High quality of code, because of the code-quality and development restrictions;


I don't know about the negative testimonials, and at the rate that lot of posts and videos are made with explanation after explanation of the inner workings of the service and the methodology, I infer that [Yegor](https://yegor256.com) understands that it'll probably take some time for this whole deal to make a lasting impression in the industry.

Truth is I don't know, I'm not the one to say whether this is a good business model or not. I'm also not one to make judgements of the methodology, I won't digress in this post with whether or not I think it works or it's just all a crazy business.
