TODO defensive tester language - and it's benefits (an dangers) in the pseudo-agile world

not lying - and not submitting to the pressure that will make you inadveredly lie - example "are we good to go? good to release? green light?"

example of how taking care of your language is indeed being truthful - and management will appreciate that with time

example of how by example - developers also understand that they should take less for granted, and also open up their minds and think more about edge cases
