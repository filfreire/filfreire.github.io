> TL;DR: testing and the "blazing fast" mindset of "we're too fast to fix our stuff!"-type of rushed software projects: why it's a bad idea, and why it's a conscious business risk and what it leads to at the end


the idea you can't keep up with development - is a test result - development is going faster than our ability of learning about the product through exploration and experimentation - this is a business risk we're taking;
what they're really saying: we could develop in a way we understand the quality of what we're making: we slow down and do reasonable testing while we develop; but our competitors are fast and don't mind shipping without testing -> "we've have to release today, because we can't waste another day; people are just rushed - people want these features for yesterday"
development may need to take in a lot of risk - when you decide you'll develop faster than you can reasonably test - you might be fine for some time - but it's a risk that the business takes;
we're going to experience embarassing bugs in the field - then we need to slow down and be more careful - if you don't want to have these, this is what you need to do;
scrum and agile don't say we need to be ultra fast, so testers better catch up, in fact they say something quite different:
