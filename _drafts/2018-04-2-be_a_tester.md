"Do your homework and eat your vegetables"


Your background makes you unique as a tester in special ways. Your craft will be very unique and different from another tester. Say you have an accounting background, or statistician, or human resources, psychologist, pharmaceutical, sports, gardener, etc. This past adds skills.
Being good with numbers and analysis
Being good with interacting with people (stakeholders, developers)
Being good with documenting stuff

It's not all glamour and easy money:

- you'll always be a bottleneck in everyone subconscious: ratio devs / tester
- managers that micromanage
- visibility of your work to others issues
- being called incompetent, and if you're not called, they're thinking it
- managers and developers who'll bully you
- companies that exploit
- companies that want monkeys and not expert testers
