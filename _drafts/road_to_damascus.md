(summary: Telling my story)

## The veil

I started out in "Testing" because a few people gave me a chance. I hadn't really "fallen in love" with Testing, in fact I didn't even know what "Quality Assurance" was or any of the like. I love programming, but I pretty much failed at interviewing for development positions and I was about 1/2 years behind my counterparts who had actual software engineering and computer science background.

TODO

in a hardcore project - developers pointing out my uselessness in what concerns the "testing" part of my job and a few of them saying that I'm incompetent

TODO

## Wake up call

Trigger - Do I really understand what is testing? How can I be a good tester?
To feed a starving man - example: taking the RSTA class

TODO

## Some things you can't change

the first impressions are hard to change - if you acted like a fool or did toxic things beyond repair, sometimes it's best to leave or more efficient to start fresh than to repair what's already old and ingrained into many minds

TODO

## Grass is greener on the other side

making better impressions after a fresh start

TODO

## The road ahead

(not the Bill Gates book :-) )

TODO

## Wrapping up - An ugly truth

This story is not all shine and sparkles. Writing about this won't also clean my "rep", I'm conscious of that. Those who have met me or interacted with me at some stages in my path know this: Stuff like being toxic towards loved ones, towards friends and even towards colleagues and strangers. Around the time the veil started to break in terms of my craft, I was still miles away on also breaking another veil, a more personal one. The bad thing to realising I was stuck to pre-conceived ideas of my craft was that I hadn't really caught up with other way more negative traits unrelated to craft: like trying to be an outright clown or in practice always subconsciously carrying within me a lot the terms of "I'm incredibly humble!" and "I'm a rising star!". I definitely burned a few bridges and definitely caused a lasting bad impression on a lot of people during this time of my life. My advice to anyone going forward: by kind and loving. Forget about making yourself "a star" or "the funny clown" - you'll only make yourself an ass. Carrying thousands of character mistakes, like the ones I made along the way, is a burden that will be with me always, even if reduced in weight with time passing.

As closing remark, be yourself, but always try to be respectful and kind and loving towards others. That's about it. Thanks for reading.
