summary: Telling my story
- being covered in smoke of "QA, Automating Testing, Manual testing is a thing and it's evil"
- A market of deception and snake oil
- The veil starts breaking - in a hardcore project - developers pointing out my uselessness in what concerns the "testing" part of my job and a few of them saying that I'm incompetent
- Wake up call - Trigger - Do I really understand what is testing? How can I be a good tester?
- To feed a starving man - taking the RSTA class
- Some things you can't change - the first impressions are hard to change - sometimes it's best to leave
- Grass is greener - making better impressions
- The road ahead
