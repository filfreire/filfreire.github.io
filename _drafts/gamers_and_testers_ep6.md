(early draft)

Hello there! This is the sixth post of my "[Gamers and Testers](https://gamersandtesters.com/)" series. In these posts I ask a guest a series of usual (and unusual) questions about their experience of being involved with software testing in the videogames industry.

My guest for this post is [Reichart Von Wolfsheild](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reichart-von-wolfsheild-986551/). /TODO
