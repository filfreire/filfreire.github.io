(early draft)

Hello there! This is the sixth post of my "[Gamers and Testers](https://gamersandtesters.com/)" series. In these posts I ask a guest a series of usual (and unusual) questions about their experience of being involved with software testing in the videogames industry.

My guest for this post is [Reichart Von Wolfsheild](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reichart-von-wolfsheild-986551/). /TODO

### 1. Return Fire was perhaps one of the handful of top favorite games shared among me and some family members. What is(are) 'THE' game(s) that are your all-time personal favourites?

/TODO

### 2. Return Fire (RF) (and RF 2) held some inovations that even for todays standards not a lot of AAA titles take into account (or on the other hand cut corners on), and that gamers miss out on: from rare gems like supporting "couch" co-op gaming in splitscreen out of the box, and at the same time allowing for networked play with others, plenty of content (missions) from the get-go, ... Do you feel that a lot of care/love/attention to detail that what was very apparent in some past titles is getting watered down through times?

/TODO

### 3. RF1 and 2 always come to my mind as examples of games that expose complex gameplay elements in a clear/crisp way while at the same time being well crafted and thought-out in terms of what happens in edge cases (leaving map area, disconnecting, getting stuck, destructible materials and environments, etc.). What are some of your top guiding key principles in terms of Testing that allowed for that demonstration of craftsmanship?

/TODO

### 4. From your experience as a leader, what kind of different elements do you believe make a Software Tester successful in testing efforts of a videogame product as opposed to a typical product?

/TODO

### 5. You had mentioned in private that you had created the QA & Test teams for RF, as well as the software tools used to track testing efforts of games like Return Fire, and that some of these software tools you now sell and maintain outside of videogame-production context, like Defense and Law firms. What were the most useful ideas and findings that helped shape these tools?

/TODO

### 6. One could say you are an inventor to the core of your being, taking into account all the things you've created. Do you feel that impacts your views on software development and software testing, as opposed to views held by software folks?

/TODO

### 7. Any advice you would give a friend wanting to join the videogames industry as a Software Tester?

/TODO

### 8. A final offtopic question: Any plans for a Return Fire "HD remake" or even a Return Fire 3?
