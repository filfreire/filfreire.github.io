1. Me and my brother spent long hours playing games like World in Conflict, and we would often discuss and dream, what would it be like to create experiences like those. What was "The Game" that made you want to join the gaming industry?
1.  I would say closest thing I played that made me want to join the Industry was KOTOR 1. 


2. What was one pre-conceived idea you had before working as a tester for games, or more broadly, working in the industry, that turned out different once you started working in the industry?
2. On this one, I did not have any prec-conceived ideas, somehow the whole "you play games whole day" sounded a bit too good to be true, so I entered the business expecting what I got, banging your head against the walls for the first 6 months.


3. What's one thing you like the most and one thing you like the least about being a tester?
3. The most ... I would say I have the freedom to experiment with different techniques, after reaching a certain experience you no longer have a Default Stage you need to look at, becomes exploratory and i love that. One thing I dislike... I would say the skepticism we get sometimes from the higher positions (all though this is changing nowadays after a few "I told you so" scenarios. Even though some of us have not only A vast gaming experience but sometimes even on the side (me, i help with esport events in different games)


4. Across all industries, a lot of times testers may carry a somewhat of an emotional charge with them, feeling responsible for bugs not found in time or for problems that are sometimes too late to fix. Would you say you feel this to a deeper extent because the products you test are something that people love and look up to as an art form?
4. First 5 years i did have moments "I FUCKING TOLD THEM IT WILL BE A PROBLEM", after that, the feeling goes down a bit, you get chewed by the "machine" a bit and you learn to let go, or focus on trying to push those things to get fixed in the next patch.


5. Often times when I'm testing, sometimes at the end of the day I feel I can no longer look at another screen. Are you still able to enjoy videogames alone or with frieds, taking into account you test them "all-day" as part of your work?
5. Here... I`m a bit lucky, since i`m a technical tester which means to the end of the project i am focused more on directing the main QC team, as well as automatization, handling optimizations. So i do get tired... of seeing a Visual Studio, Perforce and Jira screen all day :). So when i get home depending on the day i still play an hour or two to relax, games like Dota2, some world of warcraft.



6. On a few occasions when playing with friends and family, I find myself stopping to think about how I could see if the game breaks under certain conditions. Have you ever had one of these moments where a friend is telling you "Hey we're playing, stop testing" that you can share?
6. When playing with someone else, no, i usually am tied up in coordinating. When playing alone... broke my Mass Effect save a few times by falling through the world.



7. What is one thing you can think of broadly that would greatly improve the lives of testers in the gaming industry?
7. Two things I would say... Automatization testing and DNA performance gathering, some jobs like trying to find wholes in the map or Memory Leaks and streaming problems searches are literally a pain, because you cant do any action to rush it, you just need to play for hours sometimes... Having client bots that do that and leaving the tester free to look for game breaking/balance bugs... is a time and money saver. As for the DNA, its always good to have a hotspot of where the low FPS occur, on the development area side.


8. What would be your main advice for anyone that is interested to be a part of the gaming industry in the testing craft?
8. This is going to sound ominous, but... Decide what you want to do, in the gaming industry the testing career stops at one point, and then you need to decide if you want to move into Proper Quality Assurance Engineering or Data analysis. Aiming for the future job will allow you to focus on the skills needed to get there, there`s nothing wrong with trying to be a jack of all trades, but specialization testers are always a welcomed sight.
