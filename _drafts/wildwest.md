This is a no brainer for me: I’d happily leave that company asap.
Unless the code involves launching of nuclear missiles or some top secret confidential national security stuff (and even then…), I expect the same kind of access to it as a tester, as any contributor has to an open-source project: I want to see the code, the logs, the different environments, the discussions, I want to have the ability to investigate everything and anything that will influence my testing efforts.
