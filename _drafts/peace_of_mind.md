> professionals have standards - Team fortress 2

summary: overview of how a "standards" mindset withing a company, where all different and particular teams should follow the same approach to testing might in turn hinder testing efforts, or even be completely unhelpful for projects - projects that in turn need a more context-driven approach to testing

problem with standard view - focus on documentation instead of actual testing (but we're proud to do standard drudgery)
selling "peace at heart" and not selling testing
governments start listening to these things: "this is the real professional testers, pay attention to what they're saying"
doing actual testing - how it impacts
"We base our approach to test strategy and planning on ISO29119 to which we're contributor... so you are assured your test strategy will reflect the complexity of any given development project"

"best of breed process"; "proven methodology"; "certified"; "efficient"; "effective"; "guaranteed outcome"
352â‚¬ per test case
"the treasure of the standards"

selling bogus certainty and appeal to fear
"imagine something goes noticeably wrong. how easy will you find it to explain that your testing doesn't comply with international testing standards? so, can you afford not to use them?"
"don't worry, keep calm, use this standard"

document driven testing is not testing - it's filling documents
