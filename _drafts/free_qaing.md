I've been drawing a few conclusions from my personal experience with regards to a topic very familiar to hiring managers/product leads in tech teams: hiring/sourcing for Testers.

The premise being: some product people don't know what they want to hire. Some others want to hire a "QA". And some others want to hire a Tester.

The product people that want or feel the need **for Testers** in their teams, I would say, have a better chance to be a step ahead already of many other colleagues: it might be the case that they want Testers, implicitly knowing somewhat the difference of Testing as opposed to Quality Assurance or Quality Control.

But it might not be the case.

Some people can indeed be on the lookout for a "QA" professional - someone who, by [the book](TODO) is probably a very senior and experienced Programmer/Manager/Tester (one or two of the previos) - whom has the implicit power and knowledge to setup better design practices, standards and procedures into the development and testing processes, and then ways of checking and evthose against some expectations.

But for you that are reading, that may or may not know this difference already, and you tell yourself "I want a QA"... I'll commit the feat of trying to guess something (which may or may not hold true for your case):
> What you really want is a Tester. The Tester you want does not exist. But the Tester you need is out there.

And yes, I can say this with as much biased confidence as any logical falacy: because I've "been there" so many times, and the "ice cream flavor is always the same".

Why? Because we're not out of the woods - software projects are getting more complex, dumb, big, and rushed - and for the most part, the super hardcore "flow/tempo" usually means: bugs, risks, shame, limitations... always right there on the first corner waiting for you. Ready to hit you with a towel.

So unlike my usual "rant" posts (I sure do enjoy ranting) - I'm going to make this one a bit different. I'll still rant, but, I'll assume you, the reader, are already magically conviced about the "QA professional" being different from a Tester. Maybe because you feel intimidated by my previously "falaciously confident guessing" attempt. Or maybe you're just curious to see what gibberish I wrote this time.

Being conviced of the difference, it suddenly might dawn on you: so... If what I really want to hire is a Tester... what should I want to try to identify in a Tester, so I can check if maybe it's a promising candidate to join my team?


## "What *"Agile Scrum Delivery Product Owner Managers Inc."* want"

Here's what most hardcore modern projects nowadays need on a high-level (assuming they may or may not already have craftsman developers that have a strong culture of "testing" their own stuff, coding away plenty of insightful automated checks, and providing a proper hunting adventure for craftsman testers), a Tester that can:

- Can **test without any supervision** or guidance in an exploratory and hands-on experiential way anything (be it an API, a web application (frontoffice and backoffice) on desktop or on the browser in the phone, a messaging system, etc), and still find meaningful bugs, risk and confusion;
- Can conduct testing efforts both in a rapid but at the same time efficient and resourceful enough approach, making a lot with very little, hunting down for the most crucial bugs and risks in the time they're given... like a special forces tester;
- Provide meaningful evidence of testing, be it humane summaries of the testing efforts and risks for a release, or even  a “no bullshit” straightforward approach to bug reports with important information for developers and product people;
- Interacts with programmers and code (participating in code reviews, bugfixes, unit checks, code coverage, code quality tools etc.);
- Someone who is not afraid of going the extra mile – debugging issues/bugs, not conforming only on what is “apparent” but with the guts to look into logs, documentation, the code, the deployment, and monitoring related tools;
- Someone who is not afraid to own a deployment/release process (if needed);
- Someone who can code and maintain scripts for plenty of different tasks, and also code automated checks and maybe code a decent sanity or regression check suite for an API or for frontend application – with little supervision;
- Someone who is combative, and not afraid to say the truth and signals problems in a critical but constructive way.

Of course, is not easy to find a profile on market that is 100% on each of the above points. I'm personally way, way far from even getting to a point where I can say I'm decent at some of those. But, any good testers have their strengths in some of these, while being decent or promising on any other points they’re not good at of the previous list.

Testers that will not cause an impact in the kind of context of project I described above, at least a meaningful impact - tipically suffer from not being able to take care of some of the above points.

## "I want the above but the Extreme Perfect version"

If you're one of the 2 or 3 people in the world that has found this post and you want to hire a version of the Tester posted above, but the Extreme version, or the "Perfect" Tester, meaning you're wiling to go, not the extra mile, but the extra lightyear (which is a sort of head-hunting /talent-hunting I've never seen happening online publicly). What do you do in that case? Well, this is what you may want to search, if you're on that quest:

- A Tester with decent/good command of the points mentioned before, plus...
- One that can play ball on these topics: Epistemology, Risk Analysis, Exploratory process, Sociology, Coaching, Usability, ...

Here's the downside: Let's say I know personally and on contact-level, about 800 Testers. That's would be like my "first-level" and maybe "second-level" network. I can tell you that of that network, I know of only about 3 or 4 testers who are this Extreme version (and I'm certainly not one of them yet).

Here's another, lesser-known downside, if you're willing to live with it: such Testers usually have an abnormal or unusual level of integrity towards the craft of Testing to a point where they become "Sensei"-of-reference to some comunities and at the same time "offensive/censored" in other communities. Are you willing to fall into condemnation by any sort of warriors on each side, independent of who's right or wrong?

Extreme Testers like these, are not readily available in the market to test your (dumb) "latest tech `<insert-business-here>`", or to cover up for your poor product and tech decisions, without necessarily solving them and run the risk of ofending someone. Testers like these are in the market of consulting and coaching, and educating other testers.

So my advice: instead of even trying to hire one of them internally, and get a "Nope. Thanks." reply:
- either don't try to hire the "Perfect Tester", since you'll most likely get a fake, or...
- see if there's any way you can on the other hand, hire a decent/good tester, and then have that tester become an apprentice of an Extreme Tester. That way you may get all the good, without the flagellation of trying to find perfection.


## "But I want a Mobile, AI/ML, 3D, <insert-specific-context-here> kind of tester

I see this pattern online where people sometimes think the Tester they need has to be an expert in a very specific topic. It might be the case. But I'd suggest being open to the idea that your specific complexity might not be that unatainable for any craftsman software tester coming from another context. If on the other hand, you're sure, you need someone specific, here's a few things then I can recommend from experience:

/TODO

Well for a mobile tester here's what I'd look, besides what is posted on the list above:

/TODO


The tiny differences from mobile being that you’ll try to hunt in descriptions a bit more about things like:
- testing APIs (Postman, RestAssured, Rest based libraries);
- testing web applications (and any of the typical programing languages plus check automation libraries);
-  and in some cases, performance/load testing with resource to tools (jMeter, Locust, Taurus, Gatling, Siege, k6.io, …);
