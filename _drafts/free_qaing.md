I've been drawing a few conclusions from my personal experience with regards to a topic very familiar to hiring managers/product leads in tech teams: hiring/sourcing for Testers.

The product leads that want testers, I would say, may be a step ahead already of other colleagues - because it might be the case that they want testers, knowing somewhat the difference of Testing as opposed to Quality Assurance or Quality Control.

But for you that are reading, that may or may not know this difference already, I'll commit the feat of trying to guess something which may or may not hold true for your case:
- The tester you want does not exist. But the tester you need is out there.

And yes, I can say this with as much confidence as any logical falacy: because I've "been there" so many times, and the "ice cream flavor is always the same".

Why? Because we're not out of the woods - software projects are getting more complex, big, and rushed - and for the most part: super hardcore TODO/time, bugs, risks, shame, limitations

## "What *"Agile Scrum Delivery Product Owner Managers Inc."* want"

Here's what most hardcore modern projects nowadays need on a high-level (assuming they may or may not already have craftsman developers that have a strong culture of "testing" their own stuff, coding away plenty of insightful automated checks, and providing a proper adventure for craftsman testers), a Tester that can:

- Can test without any supervision or guidance in an exploratory and hands-on experiential way anything (be it an API, a web application (frontoffice and backoffice) on desktop or on the browser in the phone, a messaging system, etc);
- Can conduct testing efforts both in a rapid but at the same time efficient and resourceful enough approach, making a lot with few, hunting down for the most crucial bugs and risks in the time they're given, like a special forces tester;
- Provide meaningful evidence of testing, be it humane summaries of the testing efforts and risks for a release, or even  a “no bullshit” straightforward approach to bug reports with important information for developers and product people;
- Interacts with programmers and code (participating in code reviews, bugfixes, unit checks, code coverage, code quality tools etc.);
- Someone who is not afraid of going the extra mile – debugging issues/bugs not only on what is “apparent” but on logs, documentation, the code and monitoring related tools;
- Someone who is not afraid to own deployment process if needed;
- Code and maintain scripts for plenty of different tasks, and also code automated checks and maybe code a decent sanity or regression check suite for an API or for frontend application – with little supervision;
- Someone who is combative, and not afraid to say the truth and signals problems in a critical but constructive way.

Of course, is not easy to find a profile on market that is 100% on each of the above points. I'm personally way, way far from even getting to a point where I can say I'm decent at some of those. But, any good testers have their strengths in some of these, while being decent on other points they’re not good at.

Testers that will not cause an impact in the kind of context of project I described above, at least a meaningful impact - tipically suffer from not being able to take care of some of the above points /TODO


## "But I want a Mobile, AI/ML, 3D, <insert-specific-context-here> kind of tester

Well for a mobile tester here's what I'd look, besides what is posted on the list above:

/TODO


The tiny differences from mobile being that you’ll try to hunt in descriptions a bit more about things like:
- testing APIs (Postman, RestAssured, Rest based libraries);
- testing web applications (and any of the typical programing languages plus check automation libraries);
-  and in some cases, performance/load testing with resource to tools (jMeter, Locust, Taurus, Gatling, Siege, k6.io, …);
