> If one is Portuguese, then one is certified towels-salesperson. -- Anyone Spanish.

After moving to Spain I've come to learn that Spanish have an interesting version of the Portuguese saying "In Spain no one works, people only have siestas": Any person goes to Portugal for the sole purpose of acquiring towels.

This saying will be starting point of this post. Yes. I knew this moment would come, and probably will resurface again in the future. I'm going to give a rant about certifications. Let's go!

> DISCLAIMER: those of you who embrace "Certification" as a topic, and think this is a post made by young punk, fear not, I fully respect you, read until the end.

## An innocent suggestion

Recently a colleague from a testing community mentioned she was considering getting a software testing certification, followed a pertinent and usual question, if anyone had a recommendation for which one to do or which one NOT to do ?

I semi-inocently recommended her taking the [RSTA](TODO) and [BBST](TODO) classes, mentioning that she'd get a "certificate" at the end. My underlying thought was: if you're going to spend money on something like a "certification", so I recommended spending it on something I invested for myself and could see the benefits afterwards.

But there was a dark-side to this proposal, a less innocent side. A sort of non-harmful but a bit malicious intention: divert the person from wasting money on the "Self-proclaimed United Nations of Testers" "certifications"... So I added at the end: one gets lot of “mileage” for each bit of money spent on those classes, in both the instruments they give you, plus “certificates” you can add to linkedin/CV and others. If you want a sticker to add to your resume, I might as well recommend you a good training that at the end gives you the sticker you want, or tests you for the chance of getting that sticker.

I never know the intentions behind people and acquiring certifications, but I usually assume an underlying intention: get the shiny sticker to append and display to the resume. Be it to look "professional". Be it to pass checks on screening phases of recruitment of some potential employers. Be it to learn about something better. Whatever reason.

I believe the underlying value proposition of the certificate itself usually falls down to:
- having better odds (or worse) in screening processes;
- feeling better about yourself if you're insecure or don't yet know that your experience has value in itself with or without a "sticker".

## An innocent question

After my reply to this colleague, another colleague asked me what was my experience: if certificates provided an actual value in some process, whatever that process might be.

I layed down a few observations of my experience, with bits of analogy. In this post I'll go a bit in-detail into three of them.

## The "good training, that might offer a "certificate" scenario

Taking something the like Rapid Software Testing training completely changed my life as a tester, woke me up as a professional, gave me tools and ideas I actively use and supercharge my testing.
I'm a better tester today than I was one year ago, I learn and grow everyday at a faster rate than before taking the training.

And sure enough, there was a "certificate" at the end. Adding the sticker or not to the resume in my case hasn't really made a difference in recruitment stages, at the end of the day, "word of mouth" or showing that I care about the craft, that I care about learning, and that I want to evolve, indeed got me good chances of getting jobs where I wanted to have a job.

Notice that I'm talking about training. Not a means of getting a paper or a shiny sticker saying "I'm certified".

## "Those who are prone to greatness but yet asleep" scenario

I've met, worked with, or interviewd awesome testers, who, by the way, haven’t yet fully woken up to the powers of the "dark side", but who indeed think of taking or have taken the dreaded “self-proclaimed united-nations of testers” certifications. But whenever I ask these same people of haven taken a certification about it's value, all of them reply me the same: they recognize it didn’t really give them a lot of tools, or anything new, maybe thaught them some new lingo or vocabulary or ideas, but at end, the certificate itself didn't really served much of a purpose if not to have a sticker on the resume, increasing chances to pass some stages of screening/recruitment in some companies.

Basically the high-value proposition of these certificates that are intended level and "market people as experts in a field", like for example, the "self-proclaimed UN of testers" ones, was, on a practical level for my acquaintances, just a way of getting through the initial recruiter/HR screening processes.

That was the sole high-value proposition mentioned. For everything else, it was always a residual value, all of them always said something in the lines: the knowledge conveyed by going through the certification process, wasn't for the most part that useful in any testing efforts, and they could have acquired that particular information by reading certain books, or reading about certain topics in some articles or online.


## "I have the sticker, therefor I am..." scenario

There are people who use the "certification" sticker as a karate black belt. I have no problems with that. I respect them. I'm not very combative, in the sense that I don't go mindlessly after people who have taken certain certifications and tell them their efforts are plain crap. Why? Because I don't know what is the person's actual experience in the craft. Until I do, I give them the benefit of the doubt, and treat them the same I would treat someone who is certificate-less. But...

I do have a problem if this "black belt" came in an expensive cereal box, or was done by purchasing a series of DVDs on how to become a karate black belt-person. If I got this belt via these means, I would certainly not pick a fight aggainst a coleague of mine who was a karate champion in Spain, much less anyone on the street.


And I've realised there are also people in this spectrum who are deep asleep in the “lies of the jedi”. They believe taking a 2-class in something not only makes them prone to pass screening stages of recruitment, but also magically converts them into experts in the field.

To make matters worse, there are people that when in power help setup screening processes in their companies to actively look for these stickers in resumes, missing out on people who maybe have conquered more expertise through their work experience than someone fresh-of the exam room for the "Look at me, I'm an expert" certification.

This shouldn't happen. Screening processes should give the benefit of the doubt to __everyone__.

As my colleague who initialy asked the innocent question mentioned: "there's a subtle distinction between _having_ the certification and _displaying_ it".

## Wrapping up

There. I've ranted a bit. I feel more calm. The story of Darth Plagueis, the context-driven craftsman tester I leave for another day. I should say, it's not a story the Jedi would tell you. For those who are still confused of what the "self-proclaimed UN of testers" is, don't worry, look at some cheesy Testing/Quality job descriptions, you'll find _its name_.

As a wrap-up I want to mention two points:

One point is related to one thing the colleague from the test community mentioned:

> "The one thing I did notice was an inverse relationship between "self-proclaimed UN of testers" certification and people I wanted to hire."

On a personal level, and in my still young experience, I've also noticed this. There are indeed outliers:  I’ve met a few surprises. Something like: for every 25 candidates that display the certification, 1 fell in the category of the craftsman tester who was indeed a good candidate, despite having the certification. The reason for this, I also think, is the market is saturated with people who, again, may not understand the "subtle distinction between _having_ the certification and _displaying_ it". Likewise I've interviewed people who I did (or did not) want to hire that did not have the "I'm certified" sticker, but displayed evidence of being good (or bad) craftsman.

Another point is, I also understand, and tend to agree, for example, with the idea of people who are not skeptical about certifications in general, but for [example, embrace it](TODO):

> Certifications help you formalize your knowledge, put borders around it, and remove gaps. And they demonstrate to most of your potential employers that you’re truly serious about software engineering.

If you take the word "Software Engineering" out, and replace it with other areas, I find that this proposition still holds some truth.

There's definitely a problem in the industry, particularly tech recruitment for Testing related positions, where there's still confusion and a fetish with the "self-proclaimed UN of testers" certificates and other "teachings (lies) of the Jedi". The solution for this problem, I think, needs to come from each and any of us who love testing as a craft, with and without certificates, educating and promoting non-biased recruitment processes with regards to the "certification" topic.

And yes, because I was born a Portuguese, I'm a certified towels salesman. Take care, thanks for reading.
