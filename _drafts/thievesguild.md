Recently a startup in my home country was accused by several people and a well established designer of plagiarism.

Like a reporter would tell you in a [pewnews](TODO) segment, "I'm not supposed to give my opinion on this but", if you look at the designs they use on their website: they indeed look like a mashup of the previous work of the accusing-designer. A few weeks after I even ran across another designer of which designs also looked different from the the initially plagiarised designer, but seems to me like yet another plagiarised victim by this company, with the difference that it wasn't caught "publicly".

I'm not familiar with how the laws work in cases like this, but at one point the designer also mentioned a takedown notice would be happening soon. Furthermore, the company also did what many companies do (specially in my home country), and tried to deploy the old card of "We're sorry, BUT, we can explain, in fact we would love to explain, and have a call with you...", so they don't really show an apparent will to admit any wrong-doing anytime soon, which might make sense from a "corporate" point-of-view.

My guess is, some companies might throw this card around a lot to see if they can fool accusers or repair some PR damage by being "smarter" (or smartasses), if for instance they're dealing with gullible accusers, for example.

I'm not sure, and frankly I don't care much, now again, I'm not the right one to jump to conclusions, or to judge, these matters should be taken by people who are experts and craftsman in Law and copyright related matters.

But... this whole matter raised a few questions on my own, as a tester.

## Can a tester be stupidly blamed for this issue?

Throughout my career, which hasn't even reached a decade, I've seen testers being blammed in multiple, sometimes valid, and other times idiotic and stupid ways for problems. For example, a tipical scenario can be:

> "Something bad happened, so let's blame the person we believe should have magically foreseen and "cristal-ball" predicted that our rushed or poorly managed project ended up being released with ludicrous bugs and 0-day problems".

To tackle this blame question, I believe we need to talk about confusion: The confusion that reigns currently in our craft.

On one side: "The industry" still doesn't understand testing as an important support activity of "investigating and informing", but not necessarily magically preventing or "sealing a good fate" on products. Likewise the industry still hasn't caught on what's the actual role of someone responsible for quality assurance (who set's up processes for "quality" and makes sure they're being followed) or the role of someone responsible for quality control (who /TODO - post ref from testng comp soft book). From personal experience: Lack of "understanding" is an accelerator for idiotic claims and finger-pointing.

On the other side: I've seen the lack of testing evidence encompassed by both modern and oldish "cheerleading agile testing quality assurance" mantras setup great testers for failure right from the start. I've seen the fraility of the "infinite test-cases" crumble before real and moderately complex testing problems. Alas, we end up being to blame, with fair reason, since we're not doing a valuable support job for our projects. This added to the fact that confusion reigns, indeed, it's easy to start pointing fingers at testers for any problem and "un"reason.

So... can we as testers be blamed? Maybe. Do we end up getting blamed? Surely. Did the testers of that company that plagiarised someone's else work get unfair blame and maybe shame? Probably.

## Should a tester find this type of issues?

Our world is simple and confusing. Like seen recently in the automotive sector and the fake carbon emissions scandals: Big shot "business stakeholders" probably still sending emails daily and adding percentual points to shareholders pockets, and engineers who actually implemented the bad choices facing the law or possibly facing jailtime and similar penalties for abiding by the "strong" will of "key" stakeholders.

So shouldn't a tester find "wrongdoing" made by someone else? Shouldn't that tester ethically feel compeled to voice about these types of issues of plagiarism?

At the end of the day, blamed or not, I take it personally if I miss a meaningful and important bug.

But with regards to plagiarism in projects, to be honest I don't know what to think. Thinking for a moment, I know plagiarism is wrongdoing, but what if the employers of the tester block the tester from investing time or attention in investigating plagiarism?

/TODO

To think about what can be meaningful and important bug, I have to remind myself: to who does the value we're trying to achieve with the project matters? Is it to some stakeholders? End-users? Are we stealing someone to create that value? Are we damaging someone in order to create that value? Are we damaging someone with the value itself?

/TODO

Maybe to spot and fight aggainst plagiarism within projects, one should have a dedicated kind of professional to help do this.

## Edge-case: How can a tester deal with stakeholders who ignore unlawful practices?
