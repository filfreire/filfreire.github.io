Recently a startup in my home country was accused by several people and a well established designer of plagiarism.

Like a reporter would tell you in a [pewnews]() segment, I'm not supposed to give my opinion on this but, if you look at the designs they use on their website: they indeed look like a mashup of the previous work of the accusing-designer.

I'm not familiar with how the laws work in cases like this, but at one point the designer also mentioned a takedown notice would be happening soon. Furthermore, the company also did what many companies do (specially in my home country), and tried to deploy the old card of "We're sorry, BUT, we can explain, in fact we would love to explain, have a call with you...", so they don't really show an apparent will to admit any wrong-doing anytime soon, which makes sense from a "corporate" point-of-view.

My guess is, some companies might throw this card around a lot to see if they can fool accusers or repair some damage by being "smarter", if for instance they're dealing with gullible accusers for example.

I'm not sure, and frankly I don't care much, now, I'm not the right one to jump to conclusions, or to judge, these matters should be taken by people who are experts and craftsman in Law and copyright related matters.

But... this whole matter raised a few questions on my own, as a tester.

## Can a tester be stupidly blamed for this issue?

## Should a tester find this type of issues?
