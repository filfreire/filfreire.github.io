I've been reading this amazing book, [The Pentagon Wars](link), and my mind is in a creative limbo ever since I started. The book tells two stories, the first being what was going on in the Pentagon between the 60s up until late 80s, with regards to the whole weapon acquisiton and purchase system, filled with a  sort-of-"corruption" - a lot of interests and players - that ended producing a lot of weapons whose first versions were poorly field/operational tested and design wiser were also inadequate for proper "modern" combat. The book describes a few of these weapon systems that in early and regular versions ended up failing and causing unnecessary casualties - all because: "ship fast, break stuff, make big bucks for contractors and our friends" mentality - in detriment of human lives - actual soldiers in combat. In the second part of the book, the author, [Col. Jim Buron](link) presents his personal take on the reform he (alongside others) pushed for realistic operational testing - in order to detect early on faults and "bugs" in the Bradley vehicle. His account is a bit dark+comical: the extents that actual people in real life went to avoid realistic meaningful testing, maintaining the "establishment", we can see examples like:

Or another example:
> quote 2


I've been thinking a lot about these stories, and also pondering some learnings from [Gerald M. Weinberg's](link) [book](link).

And I decided in this post to, motivated by these stories, sketch out a few guidelines/principles that help me orienting my testing efforts towards meaningful testing:


1) Identity

2) Posture

3) Ownership

4) No bullshit
