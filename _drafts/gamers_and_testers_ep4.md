(early draft)

Hello there! This is the fourth post of my "[Gamers and Testers](https://gamersandtesters.com/)" series. In these posts I ask a guest a series of usual (and unusual) questions about their experience of being involved with software testing in the videogames industry.

My guest for this post is [Paul Farrell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faz540/). I was fortunate to meet Paul for the first time at POST/CON 2019 (you can watch the talk he gave there [on Youtube](TODO)), and to my amazement, Paul, currently working as a Test Lead over at [Gear4Music](TODO), had worked before as a Software Tester at [PlayStation](TODO). There, he had the chance to test hit titles like [Killzone: Shadow Fall](TODO) and [LittleBigPlanet 3](TODO)

/TODO


### 1. I remember fondly playing every single game of the Killzone Series, and always being at awe with all the craft that went into those games. What is THE game that, through the craftsmanship put into it, made you consider at one point joining the games industry?

/TODO

### 2. A lot of people hold the belief that Software Testing is mostly mindless button pushing. The belief is similar for our colleagues in the games industry "surely they spent all day just playing games". How close would you say that is to the reality you faced and what preconceived ideas did you have before being a tester for videogames that didn't match reality?

/TODO

### 3. Some people get to a point after a long day in front of "the screen" where they can't enjoy a game later at home. Where you still able to enjoy videogames during your "tenure" with PlayStation, and afterwards after embracing new challenges outside of the games industy?

/TODO

### 4. What was one thing that you liked the most and one thing that you didn't like about working there?

/TODO

### 5. What was it like to transition industries, while still staying invested in the software testing craft? What major differences did you spot?

/TODO

### 6. What small "gems" and lessons did you still carry with you from those times with PlayStation?

/TODO

### 7. Past 6 years from your time there, and with all the current circunstances in gaming most of us didn't image (the impact of "social", streaming, e-Sports becoming more and more it's own thing, microtransactions becoming a legal problem, and a lot of "free-to-play" AAA-producton grade titles in between) - what would you say has changed (or may have changed) specifically for Testers in the games industry since 6 years?

/TODO

### 8. What advice would you give to someone to who wants to join the Testing craft in the videogames industry?

/TODO

### 9. What would you say has roughly changed (or may have changed) in the 6 years

/TODO
