Compassion is a tricky thing in the business of selling ideas. This I believe, is true, and accurate in the current picture of the Software Testing world.

How can you possibly feel compassion for your competitors ("enemies"), those (like Mr. MacMahon would say in a skit in WWE) "nasty humans" who hold beliefs contradictory to your own beliefs? Even more so, we often try to rationalize the differences hastening a bigger void between us:

> "Surely our opposition still to this day is aggainst us, not just because they are not for us, but they are evil. They pursue their endeavours surrounding themselves in a mist of evil and attempts at stealing people's time, money and power."

And then "righteousness", smirkness and personality clashes get all mixed up in fights of "good vs. evil", oftentimes with no victor in sight, only casualties on both sides: innocent people who are lead by interim-demagogues on each side. All in the name of status-quo or furthering of "the craft".

Then we have the topic of "selective" compassion, in which different spectrums of Software Testing schools have an easier time feeling compassion towards distinct schools, but all of them have some other schools they downright hate, and cannot communicate with. We talk openly about upholding the values of applying ourselves to our context, and being open to changing the full picture in a character of openness and democracy, and in shadows we lack the spirit to mix with certain context approaches, for we believe them to be evil and of dubious efficacy, all the time.

Because we often hold our own "truths" to be self evident, fruits of our "many labours" in discipline, science and learning, we then smirk at others who hold opposite truths, and we observe this same behavior in other areas in life, aside from Software Testing. We get lost into smirkness, but life has other plans for us. The forces of life break apart our beliefs in distinct moments, leading us to crossroads where we need to pick between humility or bitterness. We tend to pick the latter.

I wouldn't say though, that this underlying conflict is evil. Science itself has for the most part been a byproduct of cycles of clashes of accounts or narrations, sometimes fueled by rivalry and hostility. In this matter, Software Testing is no different. If there's one thing we can say with some confidence about Software Testing (and even Computer Science or Software Engineering) is that there is no bit of knowledge that has survived to this day that is unchanged or transformed through time.

But I still think, to the core of my being, we are missing something. As crafts-people we've been directing our revulsions and grievances at our fellow brothers and sisters and not at their technique and art. And that's human and "normal". But we've been letting that direction take the center-stage of most (if not all) our debates of each others' artistry and aptitude.

We attack the human being behind the ideas. And we attack that human once more when we fail to recognize that indeed our crosshairs have been pointed at humans this whole time. Or on the other hand, we obsess about offensiveness, and each participant, offended and offenders, none of them are innocent in the endorsement of this attitude. I too am guilty of this, and have been a player on both sides, like in a series of Team Deathmatches in Call of Duty, where sometimes we're the reds, next round we're the blues. We're hooked on the action, the repetition and on the movement of it all, drawn away from all else.

I feel that the current Global Pandemic in this case is acting like an aforementioned crossroads, and we need to make a decision "now", and take the chance. Why? Because now, due heightened suffering, more than ever it's actually easier to recognize that there's a human being on the other side of the trenches. They suffer like you and me. They feel bored, anxious, fearful, restless. If you're lucky enough, that human being will be loving towards you, they'll see that behind your hostilities, misdeeds and your idea campaigning (in the warfare sense) there's personal adversity, bigger than the ideas themselves. This is also why we need to be alert - demagogues use, among many things, personal distress as grounds for commercializing their knowledge, as well as their deception, illusion and hidden maneuvers, with possibilities for true evil. And the only way I know of, to fight this, is following the example of people who are in the end, all things said and done, loving towards you. Love and compassion are more valuable and powerful to the betterment of the craft, than being an "authority". Empathy and grace break the biggest blockades towards good understandings about Software Testing.

Note, I'm not promoting some adage that we should from now on be timid or cowardly, or forgiving towards the crooks in the Software Testing craft. I'm also not saying that from now on we should legitimize teachings and ideas that are in essence a product of human evil and greed... But, if we have the choice of being a little bit more forgiving and loving towards those who we are quick to label as wrong, simple-minded and artless, we might have a better chance at conducting ourselves with dignity in the pursuit of "better" Testing.

We'll also have a shot at briefly seeing ourselves in the mirror from time-to-time: beautiful foolish wrecks... pretty much like everyone else.
