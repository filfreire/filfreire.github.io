"Remember they're all working on their personal brand, and there's no better way of getting attention than by being controversial. It doesn't matter if people love you or hate you - they know your name." -- Ben

People who love testing. People who say testing is dead. People who say testing is dead, only to advertise they'll bring it back like Lazarus.
