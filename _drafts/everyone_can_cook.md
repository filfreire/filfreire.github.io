## Dumb Thought

Agilists and the members of the universal church of the kingdom of agile: "we don't need testers"

TODO

## Smart, and incovinient truth

a good developer/software engineer advocates for "test-driven developers" (not to be mistaken with TDD), and a develoepr is multiple times better at automated checking, specially unit and integration level, so why would anyone need QA Engineers / Test Engineers to do any sort of automated checking? Make sense to me.

TODO

## The truth that sets us free

Good developers, software engineers and managers understand that: it's a waste of money getting someone for a role that a developer can do... BUT at the same time they understand: there is no replacement for an expert and craftsman tester. Someone who can code fairly, maybe also manage fairly well, but is an expert in anything and everything related to testing. It's the detective the project needs. The investigative journalist that goes where no one else dares to go. The person that can make use of the developers expertise in crafting unit checks or automated checking frameworks to supercharge and direct testing efforts of the whole. It's the person that learns and stays learning, well beyond what a developer and sometimes product owner can learn.

TODO

In fact - teams where each know his role, and you have super-skilled "test-driven" developers working side by side with craftsman testers - tend to be, from personal experience, supercharged and productive teams.

TODO

## Patience, Pace and Pirates

Patience, with a distinction - patience to go the first and the last mile when testing: something which is trained and requires a starving curiosity.

/TODO

Pace - trained to pursue each bit of uncertainty with skill

/TODO


Pirate - we need no permission or authorization - we sail free.

/TODO

## Wrapping up

Anybody can make unit checks. Good and skilled developers/software engineers make better unit checks than any "QA person", maybe.
Any kid can do testings. Anyone can test. Anyone can code. Anyone can write a "Shakespeare" But doing great testing, learning about the product, investigating it, reporting and signaling the most meaningful issues in the time they're given: this is a job for expert and passionate testers.
