Have you ever wondered what distopian reality the future holds for the software testing craft?

I've been thinking and wondering recently about multiple half-realistic and half-distopian future states of the testing craft and industry as a whole, and in this post I'd like to elaborate on one whose main infamous character would be the "testing-vendor" industry.

Picture the following scenario:

> A huge reliance on "testing-sweatshops" and "testing-as-a-service farmhouses". Entire "corporations" that, in a Blade Runner like fashion, are ready to satisfy your software testing needs with disposable testing labour resources (sort of like "replicants")

Could we ever reach such a state in the near or distant future?

## The "industrial age"

I didn't know that, besides the great ilusion of a UN of testers made up by some "distant council of elders",  that there's also this huge trend where tons of companies are paying (probably tons of) money for "Quality Assurance" vendors, not knowing what they're actually getting for, money-worth. Most times because they maybe don't understand testing or it's importance, and think: "surely outsourcing testing is as easy as ordering a pizza online".

I had no idea the extent of a phenonema currently underway, there's a whole market out there of what some may call "Testing sweat-shops" or "Testing-as-a-service farmhouses".

I call them sweat-shops, jokingly, of course, the more formal description is something in the lines "Testing-as-a-service" vendor. There's other names for it, but the goal is pretty much the same.

Most of the times I'm a bit "dis-illusioned" with the whole idea. It all starts with the way a portion of these vendors (safe some happy and decent outliers) market themselves, here's a few usual marketing pitches:

- "You pay us for testing services, and we'll provide thousands of test cases and advice!"
- "We'll provide thousands of latest-tech super duper automated tests!"
- "We'll automate all your testing!"
- "With the power of BDD you will prevail!"
- "We'll do great testing on christmas, at weekends and during the night!"
- "We have a wonderful super-duper expert tester ready to allocate with you right now!"
- "We have hundreds of wonderful expert automtion and manual testers that know 100 programing languages and libraries, with 30 years of experience in Cucumber, waiting in the docks!"
- "We guarantee we'll assure the quality of your product!"
- ...

Each of these points is just another different flavour or bottle of snake oil a company is trying to sell, and I doubt the inherent value of each.

The trend itself is not much different from other industries: it's a simple cluster of companies that knowingly tries to make money selling recent sayings, keywords and dreams. This is not something new.

## There are outliers

Not all is bad. There's decent chances the actual external vendor-provided tester who's providing you with testing, might be a skilled and caring tester (for example, up until now I've experienced this multiple times, having worked and currently working with awesome non-internal testers). In most good cases you end up not noticing the difference: "here's a skilled tester, a good colleague, who happens not to work in the same office I work in, but is helping the project with valuable and meaningful testing".

Or maybe the vendor doesn't blatantly sell you lies and catch-phrases like "We (magically) assure quality!", and they tell you upfront in their marketing documents: we don't make miracles, but we'll try to do a reasonable ammount of skilled testing and maybe do some resourceful automation in testing with the time that you give us. There are a few decent vendors like that out there, who don't make a business of selling the good old "Quality Assurance" or "Automated Testing" snake oil. But again, not all vendors, and not even the good majority, I've been observing, operates in this truthful form.

We should keep in mind, what we get at the end is a labour resource, harshly put, a brain and a pair of hands, to work on your project from a testing perspective. That's it. That's the "crude reality" for many minds that have the money and power to take decisions.

From a dumb business (and testing-agnostic) standpoint, in theory, the end result should not stray very far from the path of sourcing and hiring internally some testers out in the wild. So what's stopping evil vendors fighting as much as they can in the attention market and increasing the chance to get new clients? What's the problem? Right?

But, as testers we know that the outcome of this labour resource depends on multiple circunstances. And because it's vendor provided, as a company you skip the "dreaded" "problems of internal sourcing", cut some costs (which makes shareholders happy), and everybody's "happy in the end", in detriment or benefit of the project of course... the harsh reality of "subcontracting" is you did nothing but trade problems for other problems, a good deal of those problems unknown "unknowns" from start to finish.

## Now imagine "Tyrell corporations" of testing

Now, how would we go from a pool of mostly evil-intented testing-as-a-service vendors (sweat-shops) (with some exceptions/outliers) to a future ruled by Tyrell corporation?

I don't have a perfect 1-liner answer for this, but, I personally think of a distopian scenario might be reachable with the following steps, not in any particular order:

- Big testing sweatshops start purchasing small ones, and with time you end up seeing a monopoly of big "testing-as-a-service" vendors providing services to all the biggest companies listed on any stock exchange because "internal sourcing/hiring" "is hard";

- Smaller companies see the trend of big companies outsourcing testing to evil vendors, and decide to also outsource testing;

- Non-vendor regular Companies, that might influence the market (for example, they employ key testers that are influencers in communities) stop wanting to have the trouble of sourcing for their own testers, and become easy clients of testing sweatshops;

- Continuous Growth and spread of the phenomena [Certification-fetiche](TODO) and increased global influence the UN of Testers council of elders as the sole "voice of truth", with complete theory control of the industry and a slow death of the open-society model in the testing craft;

- Fading and merging of smaller independent and local testing communities under the umbrella of "happy/positive" communitys that might turn evil in the future (that in turn to promote bad testing teachings or spreading confusion/disinformation) - example, imagine a future where umbrela groups like Ministry of Testing turn completely evil and become basically a network of "Jedi Temples";

- Known testing influencers and individual consultants being financed by testing sweatshops and tools-vendors (this is happening right now in the industry);

- Known testing influencers and individual consultants actually owning or forming their own testing sweatshops, and their using their channels to further promote their companies;

- Wolves-disguised-as-sheep testing influencers, with voices that end up prevailing since that scream higher and have more "likes", conquering all attention share of the industry, and then using that attention to promote evil or bland teachings. This one deserves some more explanation. My idea is that in an era currently ruled by social justice warriors fighting for attention time and also "offensiveness is offensive" virtual words-of-order being thrown at every corner, I think the testing craft is also not free from falling into traps that might promote, for example, a narrow "cheerleader" view of what the testing society should look like.

- Big independent testing communities being financed by testing sweatshops and tools-vendors (this is happening right now in the industry); Testing podcasts that involve communities, and the podcasts are non-inocently financed by third-parties. Here I say podcasts but it can be so much more: websites, tutorials, classes, any kind of content!

- Testing conferences guided by agendas of specific Sweatshop companies or companies with strong links with umbrela testing comunites. Have your doubts? Do a something of a DDoS "attack/test" on registry and voting systems of any of current "Big" and "Major" testing conferences - you'll soon be getting private messages of CEOs of private companies that you didn't know they "owned" the conferences... Let's just say a close friend recently found out that a conference he inocently thought was "neutral" and "made by testers for testers", is in reality actual property of an actual company.

- Bonus "Blade Runner" step: mega testing-sweatshop corporation figures out how to engineer and produce actual replicants with a 4 year lifespan to perform software testing.

## Wrapping up

This is mostly plain imagination. But the core ideas are there:
- Some of the points are related to "evil-mode" testing vendors;
- Some of the points are more related to the current observable vanishing of the "open-society" model in the testing craft (bear in mind the core business of the UN of testers is not exactly friendly towards this model);
- Others yet are related to typical capitalist/business inclinations ("big company buys small company to maintain bigger marketshare");
- Others are related with power moves in communities and umbrela communities. This is ages old, and not particular to any craft alone.

There's probably more points. Now take into account all of these and think for a moment. Are we really that far of reaching a state where the future is indeed characterized by these points? How can we tackle the development of such a future? Most of these points are born of my imagination, but I'm sincerely worried that some of them may or are already turning into an actual reality.

There are more and more vendors each day, all advertising the satisfaction of any quality assurance and testing desire of both big and small companies alike. All of these vendors are also always vomiting the same market pitches.

So what's stopping this and other trends of becoming something worthy of a Blade Runner-like script? My words are not backed by a lot of actual factual data, at the moment, but again, for my imaginary scenario, I don't need it.

It's just my fertile imagination, right?
