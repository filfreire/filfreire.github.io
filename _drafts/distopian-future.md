Have you ever wondered what distopian reality the future holds for the software testing craft?

I do sometimes. I like reading posts like ["What Could Kill Testing?"](http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/5290) and other posts a like.

I've been thinking and wondering recently about half-realistic and half-distopian future states of the testing craft that I'd like to elaborate on one of them a bit in this post.

## Every future has a past

The first distopian scenario I imagine is this one: a huge reliance on "testing-sweatshops" and "testing-as-a-service farmhouses". Entire "corporations" that, in a Blade Runner like fashion, are ready to satisfy your software testing needs with disposable testing labour resources, sort of like "replicants".

To understand how we might get to this scenario, I'd like to travel a tiny bit back in the past.

I started my career as a tester roughly near the start of the year 2015. Some of you might be thinking, quite young career then. Back then I had no practical knowledge of Testing, Quality Assurance, Quality Control, their differences, and plus I was ignorant to many other related topics that nowadays I spend my time learning about (or ranting about, in this blog).

I learned with time the value and importance of the Tester's role as a support role to software development.

With time I've also come to learn about the testing industry and it's inner workings. And, amongnst the many topics I discuss about, regarding the industry, I had no idea the extent of a phenonema currently underway: there's a whole market out there of "Testing sweat-shops".

There's this huge trend where tons of companies are paying (probably tons of) money for "Quality Assurance" vendors, not knowing what they're actually getting for their money-worth, because they maybe don't understand testing or it's importance, and think: "surely outsourcing testing is as easy as ordering a pizza online".

I call them sweat-shops, jokingly, of course, the more formal description is "Testing-as-a-service" vendor.

But most of the times I'm a bit "dis-illusioned" with the whole idea. It all start with the way a portion of them (safe some happy and decent outliers) market themselves:
- "you pay us for testing services, and we'll provide thousands of test cases and advice!"
- "we'll provide thousands of latest-tech super duper automated tests!"
- "we'll automate all your testing!"
- "with the power of BDD you will prevail!"
- "we'll do great testing on christmas, at weekends and during the night!"
- "we have a wonderful super-duper expert tester ready to allocate with you right now!"
- "we have hundreds of wonderful expert automtion and manual testers that know 100 programing languages and libraries, with 30 years of experience in Cucumber, waiting in the docks!"
- "we guarantee we'll assure the quality of your product!"
- ...

Uffff. Damn, it even hurt me a bit to write down some of those down , (BTW, most of them, to me personally, are synonim with bad indicators).

I admit my observations might be lacking, but those of you who also love the testing craft are as well probably grinding your teeth and with an increased heart rate. Any tester, working inside or alongside a "Testing-as-a-service"-vendor knows what all those "sayings" and "market mantras" mean in reality or the value they hold (tip: when you see these sayings, if possible, "walk" away).

## Not all is bad...

There are outliers. There's decent chances the actual external vendor-provided tester who's providing you with testing, might be a skilled and caring tester (for example, up until now I've experienced this multiple times, having worked and currently working with awesome non-internal testers). In most good cases you end up not noticing the difference: "here's a skilled tester, a good colleague, who happens not to work in the same office I work in, but is helping the project with valuable and meaningful testing".

Or maybe the vendor doesn't blatantly sell you lies and catch-phrases like "We assure quality!", and they tell you upfront in their marketing documents: we don't make miracles, but we'll try to do a reasonable ammount of skilled testing and maybe do some resourceful automation in testing with the time that you give us. There are a few decent vendors like that out there, who don't make a business of selling the good old "Quality Assurance" or "Automated Testing" snake oil.

Keep in mind, what you get at the end is a labour resource, harshly put, a brain and a pair of hands, to work on your project from a testing perspective. That's it. From a dumb business (and testing-agnostic) standpoint, the end result should not stray very far from the path of sourcing and hiring internally some testers out in the wild. The outcome of this labour resource depends on multiple circunstances. And because it's vendor provided, as a company you skip the "dreaded" "problems of internal sourcing", cut some costs (which makes shareholders happy), and everybody's "happy in the end", in detriment or benefit of the project... the harsh reality is you did nothing but trade problems for other problems, a good deal of those problems unknown "unknowns" from start to finish.


## Imagine multiple "Tyrell corporations" of testing

We've looked a bit at the past, and the present, from my flawed point of view. Now, how would we go from a pool of testing-as-a-service vendors (sweat-shops) to a future ruled by Tyrell corporations?

Here we can let our imaginations flow. I personally think of a distopian scenario might be reachable with the following steps, not in any particular order:

- Big testing sweatshops start purchasing small ones, and with time you end up seeing a monopoly of big "testing-as-a-service" vendors providing services to all the biggest companies listed on NYSE as well as smaller companies;

- Regular Companies that influence the market (that employ key testers that are influencers) stop wanting to have the trouble of sourcing for their own testers, and become easy clients of the testing sweatshops, since the sweatshops start owning more market share of "testing influencers";

- Growth of the phenomena [Certification-fetiche](TODO) and the UN of Testers as the sole "voice of truth", with complete theory control of the industry;

- Fading and merging of smaller independent and local testing communities under the umbrella of "happy/positive" communitys that might turn evil in the future (helping to promote bad testing teachings or spreading confusion/disinformation) - example, Ministry of Testing;

- Big testing influencers being financed by testing sweatshops and tools-vendors;

- Big independent testing communities being financed by testing sweatshops and tools-vendors;

- Testing conferences guided by agendas of specific Sweatshop companies or companies with strong links with umbrela testing comunites. Have your doubts? Do a something of a DDoS "attack/test" on registry and voting systems of any of current "Big" and "Major" testing conferences - you'll soon be getting private messages of CEOs of private companies that "own" the conferences.


There's probably more. Now take into account all of these are born of my imagination, but I'm sincerely some of them may or are already turning into an actual reality.

TODO

## Wrapping up

There are more and more vendors of these each day, all advertising the satisfaction of any quality assurance and testing desire of both big and small companies alike.

So what's stopping this trend of becoming something worthy of a Blade Runner-like script? My words are not backed by actual factual data, at the moment, but again, for my imaginary scenario, I don't need it.

It's just my fertile imagination, right?
