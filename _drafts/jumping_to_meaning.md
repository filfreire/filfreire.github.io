A lot of times when doing hands-on experiencial testing, or preparing data for a load test, or even reviewing and coding unit checks I find myself jumping to conclusions.

The explanation of the psycological term witht the same name goes about somethig like this:

> "communication obstacle where one "judge[s] or decide[s] something without having all the facts; to reach unwarranted conclusions" ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_to_conclusions))

The thing, often when testing I don't have all the information, or all the facts. I'm most often hunting for them, based on observations and assumptions, using testing as a vehicle to find information about known unknowns, risks, and even dispell illusions I or any other member of my team has.

But there's trouble in this: by being based on my assumptions I'm not setting a "perfect" course nor going about with silver bullet material to start with. I end up directing my testing efforts oftetimes unknowingly (or distractedly) setting myself up to stumble upon unforseen troubles, unknown unknowns, or apparent issues that are apparent, say, in the production deployement of what it is I am testing at any moment for example.

## Examples of stumbling

### 1) The apparent hidden characteristic

Looking at a problem through a set mind, looking at what's apparent, and forgetting to look at the problem with more than one perspective. /TODO - (example "finding all squares in a figure")

### 2) The unforseen function

Following the clearest and "most important" user paths, forgetting that in the same context, any minimal user path could be an entryway for malicious usage, and is as important as the "largest-user-behaviour-fitting" paths, hence missed it during initial testing. /TODO

### 3) The unforseen load

Based my efforts on small event loads. Prepared for a number of times that small load, thinking it would shed some light on a bigger event. Ended up with dealing with a giant event - thinking that linerarity is still the case - problems follow. /TODO
