Someone over at _self-proclaimed united nations of testers_, also known as _International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB)_ published recently a letter (a white paper really) of what I assume is the result of going to the bathroom after a hardcore magic-mushroom fueled session while watching Blade Runner 2049. And the mushrooms hit so hard, they probably were left thinking that the _Wallace Corporation_ is the hero of the story. 

Jokes aside, my belief is that what the white paper means for the industry and the testing professionals should not go unchecked. You can read the full thing [here](https://www.istqb.org/documents/ISTQB_The_Vision_on_the_Future_of_Software_Testing_Final.pdf). 

Here's a few excerpts on the white paper:
- "Software testing is moving towards more automation"; 
- "In the future, there will be more testing technology solutions"
- "The testing technology solutions will have ‘intelligence’ built into them." 
- "These testing technology solutions will iteratively learn the testing discipline from testers and testing experts"
- "The testing technology solutions will also learn from themselves and, therefore, teach themselves as part of the iterative learning and evolving testing discipline, especially emphasizing testing quality attributes."
- "The testing technology solutions will have the ability to explain to testers and testing experts the rationale supporting their recommendations and solutions."
- "As more software solutions are being made available for use and as these software solutions expand into more industries, there needs to be a greater definition and integration of the training solutions for testing professionals."
- "Testing professionals shall need to embrace the new methodologies and technologies around software development and testing, with intent to integrate these faster into their testing technology solutions."

If you know me personally or from my writings, you probably guess what I'm thinking: A lot of potential hogwash in so few sentences, to avoid calling it something else.

But I for one am going to hold my feelings for a moment, and dissect a bit what this might mean, and I'll be doing it thinking about:
- the people who have respect and love for the Testing craft, unlike the ISTQB as an abstract group (and I'm willing to grant, not necessarily some its individuals, since I know quite a few of them who love and respect Testing);
- the people whose pockets and savings accounts are in the ISTQB crosshairs;
- the people whose pockets and savings accounts are in the crosshairs of groups and individuals that in one way or the other oppose the ISTQB angle in the craft;
- anyone else who may care.

## The "move towards automation"

The "saying" that the craft is pointed in the direction of automation holds some truth to it, as well as horse droppings.

It's undeniable that, from a "buzz" standpoint, indeed Software Testing seemingly has been moving more towards "Automation". The common industry accepted- understanding is that there is such a thing as Manual Testing, and the paired industrial understanding that where you see the word "Manual", there's bound to be a machine that can do it better. And in this sense, there's no mute button for reality, and the reality is: News tools. New software libraries. AI "doing it for us". New ways of representing a view in an object. New ways to call an API or publish a message in the context of a scenario that will assert something in the end. New ways of organizing "testing" code. etc. Even personally, it's undeniable: I spend a portion of my working day coding, using tools, and maintaining scripts, and I'm a Tester.

The horse dropping part is when you confront the "buzz" with different abstractions of the whole Testing phenomenon: __Testing is undeniably humane.__ There's simply no way around it.

Reducing Testing to logical assertions written in a programming language, or mixing that with some "intelligence" (aka. some dumb machine learning model), is indeed a faulty approximation of Testing as a whole, that comprises playing, investigating, exploring, dealing with confusion, risks, problem hunting, communicating, representing, and yes, also checking.

This has been happening now for maybe almost two decades, and people left and right have come forth on plenty of occasions saying similar both "true-ish and horse dropping" words of order: "Test is Dead", "Automation Testing is the future", "Bots will replace human testers", "Agile testing is a thing", "The death of manual testing is NOW", "Let's all get along, testers are cheerleaders", ...

The above ends up being paced alongside their counterpart: individuals and small groups of people pointing out that:
- No, testing isn't dead, it's more alive than ever. In fact there's an ever growing hunger for testing that is not braindead but is rich with substance;
- No, you can't automate testing. Testing is not just "logical checking";
- No, bots can't replace humans. They can aid in tasks;
- No, agile testing is not really a thing. You have testing and it's surrounding context where it's inserted;
- No, manual testing is not really a thing, the same way it doesn't make sense to say manual thinking, manual questioning, ...;
- No, we can't get along. We can still be friends outside of work, even lovers, but we need to have some level of critical distance to hunt down certain bugs and problems;
- ...

And there's always these two sides, who both offend and feel offended, invested in a strugle between those who have over-simplifying models for something chaotic that is strongly dependent on its context, and those who oftentimes enclose themselves in tribal behavior, whose ideas suffer for being produced by faulty and imperfect humans. Curiosly enough, I think both sides would be able come up with ways to tag any of the above descriptions to the opposing side. Every year there's a whole living and breathing market for trainings, conferences and posts built around promoting or deconstructing these words of order, propagated globally faster and faster on every iteration.


## The "intelligence"

I admit there's bound to be software now and in the future that can mimic certain aspects of our natural intelligence. I also admit there is the possibility to build inteligent agents who can greatly surpass humans in certain specific capabilities or very specific activities. I also have no desire to trash the past and ongoing work of people who are dedicating their lives towards investigation in artificial intelligence, machine learning, or its several brain-children like deep learning, and networks and specific algorithms.

## A last remark

I'd like to direct this part to the team behind the white paper, if they ever read this post:

_Fellas_, I'm just a random dude. Not accomplished in much. Definitely not a bright mind. Ask some of my old and current colleagues, they can tell about all the times I was a jackass. It would be a folly for me to, without knowing any of you, to go ahead and say you're all a bunch of boneheads. It's not necessarily brave from my side to also just take on some "group", without considering there's real human beings behind it. You wanna make a buck selling (~~or imposing~~ to the industry) training and "I'm certified" stickers, be my guest: I don't like it. It's no secret I'm against it, and my personal experience tells me time and time again, there is a indeed a better way. But really, I'm not in an ideal position to judge any of you. 

I would like for you, if any of you reads this, to keep this in your hearts: the future we will all get to live on the little time we have on this earth, in part is a future of our choosing, both individually and collectivly. You've made your choice, and probably the near future will prove it a right choice for your pockets, personal well being and standing in the overall community. History is curious though, everyone says History doesn't forget. "People don't forget, nothing gets forgiven" would a character say in RDR1.

We unconsciously post our inner lives online, fly on planes, install security devices in our homes, drive to work, order food online, check our savings in a half second, invest in Tesla stocks with a tap of our fingers, and later on we will get automatically transfered our retirement money every month. Each of these things and so many more of them are built by imperfect humans, tested by imperfect humans (when and if they ever get meaningfully and decently tested), and sometimes, sure enough, kill imperfect humans. And I'm afraid, because we don't have to go very far off into the future, the present times prove to us that to make an "inteligent automated software testing" soup, or "half-assed certified" testing efforts, and think it'll remotely replace a craftsman and imperfect tester, is an entry way for more and more embarassing bugs, which will potentially lead to the demise of many fellow humans. And the first responsible wont be the tester or the developer who either missed finding the bug, or inadvertedly coded the bug. Neither will it be the greedy business man standing behind them.

To educate is to have limitless power. But Uncle Ben is there to remind us of the equaly limitless responsibility. The first people responsible are indeed the educators and in the limit, the "certifiers". You may never be convinced that Testing is humane to its core and will always be even if we paint it over with terrible science fiction, but keep in mind there are always consequences, positive and negative, in educating about Testing, whatever your angle is.

As educators, never forget that if we live, breath and mostly make a profit of "defined and integrated training solutions and certifications", for our fellow imperfect humans, nothing will ever clear any blood we may gather on our hands through time.

Take care.
