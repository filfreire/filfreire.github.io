Someone over at _self-proclaimed united nations of testers_, also known as _International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB)_ published recently a letter (a white paper really) of what I assume is the result of going to the bathroom after a hardcore magic-mushroom fueled session while watching Blade Runner 2049. And the mushrooms hit so hard, they probably were left thinking that the _Wallace Corporation_ is the hero of the story.


You can read the full thing [here](https://www.istqb.org/documents/ISTQB_The_Vision_on_the_Future_of_Software_Testing_Final.pdf). But here's a few excerpts on the white paper:
- "Software testing is moving towards more automation"; 
- "In the future, there will be more testing technology solutions"
- "The testing technology solutions will have ‘intelligence’ built into them." 
- "These testing technology solutions will iteratively learn the testing discipline from testers and testing experts"
- "The testing technology solutions will also learn from themselves and, therefore, teach themselves as part of the iterative learning and evolving testing discipline, especially emphasizing testing quality attributes."
- "The testing technology solutions will have the ability to explain to testers and testing experts the rationale supporting their recommendations and solutions."
- "As more software solutions are being made available for use and as these software solutions expand into more industries, there needs to be a greater definition and integration of the training solutions for testing professionals."
- "Testing professionals shall need to embrace the new methodologies and technologies around software development and testing, with intent to integrate these faster into their testing technology solutions."

A lot of hogwash in so few sentences.

But I for one I'm going to hold my feelings in a moment, and dissect a bit what this all means, not only for people who, unlike the ISTQB, have respect and love for the testing craft, but for people whose pockets and savings accounts are in the ISTQB crosshairs.

Fellas, I'm just a random dude. Not accomplished in much. Definitely not a bright mind if you ask some Google interviewer or some of my old Maths teachers. Ask some of my old and current colleagues, they can tell about all the times I was a jackass. It would be a folly for me to, without knowing any of you, to go ahead and say you're all a bunch of boneheads. It's not necessarily brave from my side to also just take on some "group", without considering there's real human beings behind it. You wanna make a buck selling ~~imposing~~ trainings and "I'm certified" stickers, be my guest, I'm not in an ideal position to judge.

Still, I would like for you, if any of you reads this, to keep this in your hearts: the future we will all get to live on the little time we have on this earth, in part is a future of our choosing, both individually and collectivly. You've made your choice, and probably the near future will prove it a right choice for your pockets, personal well being and standing in the overall community. History is curious though, everyone says History doesn't forget. "People don't forget, nothing gets forgiven" would a character say in RDR1.

We unconsciously post our inner lives online, fly on planes, install security devices in our homes, drive to work, order food online, check our savings in a half second, invest in Tesla stocks with a tap of our fingers, and later on we will get automatically transfered our retirement money every month. Each of these things and so many more of them are built by imperfect humans, tested by imperfect humans (when and if they ever get meaningfully and decently tested), and sometimes, sure enough, kill imperfect humans. 

We don't have to go very far off into the future. The present times prove to us that to make an "inteligent automated software testing" soup, or "half-assed certified" testing efforts, and think it'll remotely replace a craftsman and imperfect tester, is an entry way for more and more embarassing bugs, which will potentially lead to the demise of many fellow humans. And the first responsible wont be the tester or the developer who either missed finding the bug, or inadvertedly coded the bug. Neither will it be the greedy business man standing behind them.

To educate is to have limitless power. But Uncle Ben is there to remind us of the equaly limitless responsibility. The first people responsible are indeed the educators and in the limit, the "certifiers". 

As educators, never forget that if we live, breath and mostly make a profit of "defined and integrated training solutions and certifications" for our fellow imperfect humans, nothing will ever clear any blood we may gather through time on our hands.
