> What could really kill the soul of Software Testing?

Back in April 2019 I wrote a piece called [A dystopian testing future
](https://filfreire.com/posts/dystopian_future) where I wondered through half-realistic and half-dystopian future states that the testing craft and industry as a whole might reach.

I think about it in retrospect, and on some of the most negative points I was actually fairly "positive" so I want to update a few of my previous ideas.

I was not considering "worser-case scenario" where the whole humanity would be plagued with something that shattered a lot of "glass roofs" in the industry, that we collectively thought were rock solid. One way or the other, no matter how aloof we are, every single software tester in the world has been on a personal (and professional) way affected by one or more of these:
- the pandemic,
- tragic death,
- racism and suffering,
- police violence,
- mass shootings,
- wild fires,
- plan crashes,
- attacks on freedom of speech and thought,
- attacks by demagogues on local and world political affairs,
- and many more problems at a scale that caused tremendous...

The suffering caused by these issues shows no intention of stopping.

Most of these crisis invariably spilled over to the software testing world. They forced a lot of good folks to adapt, but they also helped mischievous/bad actors increase in their level of trickery. I would like to reflect in this post a bit on the latter, as a follow-up to my [previously mentioned post
](https://filfreire.com/posts/dystopian_future).

A practical example, not specific to software testing: companies with online/software businesses, where everyone only needs a computer and an internet connection to deliver value, the same companies that rushed to the internet to spread positivity, "stay healthy" and "we shall prevail" messages back in March/April 2020, are yet still not facing reality and try and shove folks back to the office, only to send them home a few days later since someone ends up getting infected again (duh!). But wait, there's more!

## "I shall sing you the song of my people"

Here's some personal freaky observations and pseudo "big brain" predictions:

A big portion of the crowd, from across all different schools of testing, folks that either made heavy use of "trainings and/or certifications" or relied on the whole conference circuit to spread their messages and sell different products, had to adapt. Some adapted guided by compassion and some doubled-down on "*101 online marketing dirty tricks*", investing a lot of effort and money into their own online-based "sales" channels.

With growing physical presence and alarm-state restrictions, the extinction of small and local Software Testing communities is accelerated, I would add "inevitable". On the other hand, communities that were previously backed by a strong online presence (or founded on *online marketing dirty tricks sales* principles) survive and (possibly) thrive, and the vampiric relationship between big communities and private corporate backed testing conference circuits will either become more apparent for folks who are paying attention, or will become more indistinguishable, if done well enough to distract a bigger portion of the crowd.

Dependency in testing-sweatshops (or their "attractiveness") will grow to unrecognizable levels. I think this is the case for two reasons:
- There's an increasing offer of (newly created) "remote-forever" jobs, desperate of hiring craftsman and expert testers / test engineers;
- Good testers, no longer chained by factors that only made sense in the pre-pandemic world, will leave "flesh-and-blood" workplaces a bit everywhere around the globe, and go to work remotely in fairer places where their skills are in higher-demand;
- A vacuum of testing talent in companies that were heavily dependent on localized status or localized "benefits" will grow;
- To fill that vacuum - companies either stop testing, turn their faith towards bland and soul-less human scripted testing or shallow automation in test, or double down on using testing sweatshops, subliminally adopting mantras of "headcounts over expertise".

(Note: After conferring with **Captain Obvious**, actually this last point would not just happen solely for Software Testers, but likely for almost all folks involved in building software. And Testing sweatshops built with remote folks will become also more of a thing, as opposed to single-country localized sweatshops.)

Testing sweatshops and tools-vendors will be doubling down on financing and hiring/siding with known testing "influencers" and individual consultants across all schools of testing, which could potentially be done so strategically to make use of the influencers sales channels and audiences, not that different in values from the companies that put some youtube or instagram influencer specialized in some craft on their paycheck.

## But wait there's even more!

Heres a few other things I didn't notice back then, of which the signals became higher than the noise, now that folks had an increased presence online that was perhaps restricted to in-person interactions, to a point where these points become visible, with Software Testing influencers:

- Showing where they stand on issues like pandemic countermeasures, vaccination, class-consciousness, misinformation, which will, depending on where folks stand with these issues, detract them from paying attention to any Software Testing related messages;
- Showing more "skin" of where they stand in the different political scales of their countries/communities. We will se an increase in signals done via usual channels these folks use, either promoting values and interests like freedom, care and compassion, knowledge and understanding or, on the other hand, folks siding with demagogues, mislead or fake information, racists and xenophobes, professional liars, rapists, pedophiles, ...
- With the overall confusion of communications/information transfer the world is in, and the influence of where seemingly topics like science are held with the same value as lies and fallacies, folks that will side with the aforementioned sides of the political spectrum which exist in many forms in their different local realities, will have a hard time achieving dialogue with other folks, and in between frustrated attempts to talk about Testing problems, we will notice a cacophony of memes, mislead comments, and hateful discussions about world issues, where in the past we saw instead a cacophony and deafness between schools of Testing on actual Software Testing problems and topics;

The overall confusion and evil will become a prevalent topic Software Testers will have to take care, as it is slowly carried over to the corporate world and to the realities of the workplace, with different workplaces adopting either more humane or more tyrannical postures.

## Is it all bad? Any good predictions?

It's hard for me to make any positive pseudo-predictions, as for the most part, with the above and previous posts on similar topics, I've done nothing but play with negative ideas and possible scenarios in my head.

I think there might be positive points. It would be a folly for me to believe IÂ´m the only one thinking about these issues, and not everyone is asleep or not paying attention to both overall world issues (some of which have existed through centuries) as well as issues in Software Testing.
