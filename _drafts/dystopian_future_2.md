> What could **really** kill the soul of Software Testing?

Back in April 2019 I wrote a piece called [A dystopian testing future
](https://filfreire.com/posts/dystopian_future) where I wondered through half-realistic and half-dystopian future states that the software testing craft and industry as a whole might reach.

Nowadays I think about that post a lot in retrospect, and on some of the most negative points I'm beginning to think was actually fairly "positive" so I want to update a few of my previous ideas.

When imagining all those different points in the other post, I was not considering a "worser-case scenario" where the whole humanity would be plagued with something that shattered a lot of "glass roofs" in the industry, that we collectively thought were bullet proof. One way or the other, no matter how aloof we are, every single software tester in the world has been on a personal (and professional) way affected by one or more of these:
- the pandemic,
- tragic deaths,
- racism and suffering,
- police violence,
- mass shootings,
- wild fires,
- plane crashes,
- attacks on freedom of speech and thought,
- attacks by demagogues on local and world political affairs,
- ...

Most of these crisis invariably spilled over to the software testing world in ways unexpected. They forced a lot of good folks to adapt, but they also helped mischievous/bad actors increase in their level of trickery. I would like to reflect in this post a bit on the latter, as a follow-up to my [previously mentioned post
](https://filfreire.com/posts/dystopian_future).

## "I shall sing you the song of my people"

Here's some personal freaky observations and some pseudo "big brain" predictions:

Let's kick off with an example not specific to software testing: companies with online/software businesses, where everyone only needs a computer and an internet connection to deliver value, the same companies that rushed to the internet to spread positivity, "stay healthy" and "we shall prevail" messages back in February/March/April 2020, nowadays fail to face reality and literally try to shove folks back to the office, only to send them home a few days later since someone ends up getting infected again (duh!). If this specific trend persists, a lot more folks will likely get infected unnecessarily. But wait, there's more!

A big portion of the crowd, from across all different schools of testing, of folks that either made heavy use of "trainings and/or certifications" or relied on the whole conference circuit to spread their messages and sell different products, had to adapt. Some adapted guided by compassion but others doubled-down on approaches right of a "*101 online marketing dirty tricks*" book, investing a lot of effort and money into their own online-based "sales" channels.

With growing physical presence and alarm-state restrictions, the extinction of small and local Software Testing communities is accelerated, I would add "inevitable". On the other hand, communities that were previously backed by a strong online presence (or founded on *online marketing dirty tricks sales* principles) survive and (some) thrive. This would be good, if not for the vampiric relationship between big communities and private entities or corporate backed testing conference circuits. This relationship will either become more apparent for folks who are paying attention, or will become more indistinguishable, if done well enough to distract everyone.

Dependency in testing-sweatshops (or their "attractiveness") will grow to unrecognizable levels. I think this is the case for these reasons:
- There's an increasing offer of (newly created) "remote-forever" jobs, desperate to hire craftsman and expert testers / test engineers;
- Good testers will become a rarer commodity: no longer chained by factors that only made sense in the pre-pandemic world, many will leave "flesh-and-blood" workplaces a bit everywhere around the globe, and go to work remotely in fairer places where their skills are in higher-demand and better compensated;
- There will be a growing vacuum of testing talent in companies that were heavily dependent on localized status or localized "benefits";
- To fill that vacuum - companies will either stop testing, or turn their faith towards bland and soul-less human scripted testing or shallow automation in test, or double down on using testing sweatshops, subliminally adopting mantras of "headcounts over expertise".

(Note: After conferring with **Captain Obvious**, actually this last point would not just happen solely for Software Testers, but likely for almost all folks involved in building software. And Testing sweatshops built with remote folks will become also more of a thing, as opposed to single-country localized sweatshops in Latin America, South and Eastern Europe and the bigger ones in South Asia.)

Testing sweatshops and tools-vendors will be doubling down on financing and hiring/siding with prominent testing "influencers" and individual consultants across all schools of testing. Some of it might be for the benefit of the community, but we can't discard the possibility that another part of it would be done so strategically to make use of the "influencers" sales channels and audiences, with an underlying purpose not that different in values from the companies that put some youtube or instagram influencer specialized in some craft on their paycheck.

Tools-vendors/Testing consortiums might also double down on gaining territory in Testers minds by means of creating platforms/channels. They would finance plenty of initiatives, virtual conferences and communities. Plenty of Testers would be given opportunities to be alongside current prominent Testing figures. A part of this would be done for the benefit of the community, that was in need of diversity for a long time. Another part of it will be for a hidden call to arms, not that different from what companies are already doing when trying to keep small monopolies in the open source software space as well as "lobbying" in non profit consortiums.

## But wait there's even more!

It will be increasingly more common to see prominent Software Testing figures going public about a range of topics. For example:

- Where do they stand on issues like pandemic countermeasures, vaccination, class-consciousness, misinformation, ...;
- Where they stand in the different political scales of their countries/communities;
- Topics like science and factual truth will be increasingly held with the same face value as lies, memes and fallacies;
- ...

We can expect a steady increase in a cacophony of memes, misleading comments, and hateful discussions about world issues, where in the past we saw instead a cacophony and deafness between schools of Testing on actual Software Testing problems and topics. Anything will go: either promoting values and interests like freedom, care, compassion, knowledge and understanding or, on the other hand, promoting demagogues, misleading and/or fake information, racists and xenophobes, professional liars, rapists, pedophiles, ...

The overall confusion mixed with evil will become a prevalent issue Software Testers will have to thread on, for example, as it is carried over to their day-to-day lives or to the workplace, with different workplaces adopting either more humane or more tyrannical modes of operation.

## Is it all bad? Any good predictions?

Until now, I've done nothing but play with negative ideas/scenarios. It would be a folly for me to believe IÂ´m the only one thinking about these issues, and not everyone is asleep or not paying attention to both overall world issues (some of which have existed through centuries) as well as pressing issues in Software Testing. There's a couple of positive things that I think might happen soon (or are already happening).

The "the latest trend in automation in test frameworks" cycle has been ruling for a bit over a decade. A few people also notice that the advertised next cycle, of using AI and machine-learning is nothing but a cash-grab, similar to what "[load testing middle-man companies](https://filfreire.com/posts/how_to_get_rich_fast)" already do. People will tolerate this reality up until a point they are absolutely tired of it.

Initially, people will stop contributing to the "orgy" of trying to solve the same problem:

> how to manage, execute and represent "action-assertion" cycles against Web apps, mobile apps, APIs, ...

Some will think:

*"There has to be a higher purpose and a more meaningful problem to solve than this... for example, there's only so many fancy ways of doing a special http client that can perform assertions until it becomes boring..."* .

This should trigger a start of a revolution.

What projects, problems and solutions will brew in that revolution? I'm not sure, but here's one I can think about, an issue that has been ignored for decades: **inclusive interfaces/structures/wrappers for "bigger" automated checks**.

These bigger checks will target entire systems, and the projects built to achieve this will aim provide easy ways for non technical folk (and craftsman Testers) to have a greater tool control, enabling esoteric tests that require complex mixtures of:
- infrastructure setup
- custom environment deployments
- instancing large test data sets,
- performing specific data consistency measurements (and assertions) on different exposed APIs,
- triggering typical automated checks (that would cover edge cases or scripted scenarios hard to reproduce without tooling),
- triggering load, performance and stress checks
- ...

Up until now, the reality is most folks solve each of these points through combining different tools, but, NEVER take the next step of abstracting all of it in a single inclusive interface. This will hopefully become a thing of the past, "after the revolution", and in the near future we would see plenty of choices of tooling that solves all of this through single easy to use interfaces. Tooling that is built on solid principles, and that is at the same time inclusive and hackable. Soon, folks won't worry about the choice of automated in test frameworks to solve small problems, they will be enabled and focused on solving bigger and more meaningful test engineering problems.

Lastly, micro communities will be organically formed with folks that are disillusioned with almost all of the prominent schools/churches of Testing, be it factory, agile, charismatic, self-proclaimed united nations of testers, context-driven, rapid, and many others. I think about the Anonymous movement, from its first "lulz"-based campaigns against scientology, to its transition into coordinated (h)activism against governments and corporations and I wonder: once something similar happens in the Software Testing craft, a lot of promising changes and revolutions will soon follow.

Anonymous Testers of all ethnic groups, genders, religions, sexuality and disabilities, will likely be the ones keeping the soul of Testing alive. These micro communities will get the closest than anyone has ever been to solving deep testing problems in a leaderless and self sufficient way, not wanting to be attached to any particular denomination. When identified, many of them will be hated and despised by all current schools of testing, for being anti-monopoly and anti-denominational, but they will also be a genuine "light" against greed of groups and individuals that profit off of selling any sort of knowledge, standards, rules, certifications, trainings, and even consulting.

Knowledge will run free. We shall see. Or not. One thing is certain: this particular revolution [will likely not be "on Twitter"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnJFhuOWgXg). It will live first in Testers' minds.
