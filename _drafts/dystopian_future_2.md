> What could really kill the soul of Testing?

Back in April 2019 I wrote a piece called [A dystopian testing future
](https://filfreire.com/posts/dystopian_future) where I wondered through half-realistic and half-dystopian future states that the testing craft and industry as a whole might reach.

I think about it in retrospect, and on some of the most negative points I was actually fairly "positive, and was not considering a "worser-case scenario" where the whole humanity would be plagued with something that shattered a lot of glass roofs in the industry, that we collectively thought were rock solid.

A big portion of the crowd, from all schools of testing, that made use of "trainings and/or certifications", or relied on the whole conference circuit to spread their messages or sell different products, had to adapt and turn to "101 online marketing dirty tricks" to double down on surviving sales channels while other channels closed shut with no prospect of ever opening back in near future.

Small and local Testing communities extinction is made "more inevitable", only communities backed by a strong online presence (or founded on the online marketing dirty tricks sales school) thrive and survive, and big community and conference circuit vampiric relationship becomes more apparent.

A number of companies with online/software businesses, where everyone only needs a computer and an internet connection, the same companies that rushed to the internet to spread positivity, "stay healthy" and "we shall prevail" messages back in March/April 2020, are yet still not facing reality and try and shove folks back to the office, only to send them home a few days later since someone ends up getting infected again (duh.).

Dependency in testing-sweatshops is seemingly bigger - with an increasing offer of newly created remote-forever jobs, craftsman and expert testers leave "flesh-and-blood" workplaces a bit everywhere around the globe, and go to work remotely in fairer places where their skills are in higher-demand, creating a vacum of testing talent in companies that were heavily dependent on localised status or localised "benefits". To fill that vacuum - companies either stop testing, turn their faith towards bland and soul-less automation in test, or double down on using testing sweatshops, subliminally adopting mantras of "headcounts over expertise".

Testing sweatshops and tools-vendors doubling down on financing and hiring/siding with known testing influencers and individual consultants across all schools of testing, which could potentially be done so strategically to make use of the influencers sales channels and audiences, not that different in values from the companies that put a youtuber or instagrammer specialized in some craft on their paycheck.

## The world around us changes, so do we

Heres a few other things I didn't notice back then, of which the signals became higher than the noise, now that folks had an increase presence online that was perhaps restricted to in-person interactions, to a point where these points become visible:

The world being in such conflict, not only with the pandemic, but all of the other issues

- Testing influencers showing more skin or where they stand in the different political scales of their countries/communities

- Testing influencers showing where they stand on issues like pandemic countermeasures, vacination, class-consciousness, misinformation, ...



TODO - to be continued
