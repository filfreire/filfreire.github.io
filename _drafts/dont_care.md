# "Don't care".

I recently saw a video made by Yegor Bugayenko about A, B and C players on a team. You can watch the same video [here](TODO LINK). The video reminded me of an issue I've noticed first-hand on my short professional life so far: That some people, in particular an portion of Testers and QAs don't care.

For every 10 testers out there, maybe only 1 or 2 are actively trying to be better professionals, evolving, going to meetups, conferences, participating in communities, learning from experts like James Bach, Lisa Crispin, Michael Bolton, Maaret Pyhäjärvi, Angie Jones, and the list goes on. The rest don't care or don't know and don't want to know.

And sure, we can all excuse ourselves for not caring: work-life balance, "my life is so much more than testing", among many other responses, but the thing is, they're still excuses.

When you have a hobby you love you dedicate a portion of your time to it, and you try to fit that in with everything else in your life, and even create routines around it. But for many testers, testing and QA is not a true passion, a true hobby, and a moving force in their lives. We can discuss if that is good or bad, but I won't digress into that, everyone has their view on it.

The thing I want to digress is: yes, it's true many people don't care. They don't. And they can say all they want but at the end of the day their actions show otherwise, but ...

## Is that bad??

A lot can be said here, but I'll try to put it on practical terms, that I actually saw happening by experience. Not caring can lead you to:

- Miss out the fact your company can pay YOU a $1k worth training session with a world-renown tester (like James Bach or Michael Bolton, or Lisa Crispin, etc.);
- Miss out the fact your company can pay you another $1k to go to a true testing conference where you can, besides watching talks and going to workshops, do networking, getting to know other testers and learning from their experiences both in testing and in life;
- Miss out on local meetups and user groups made up of all types of people who you can learn from and share and evolve as a professional;
- Miss out on all possible contacts and future friends that can somehow help you get that dream job at that company you've always been dreaming of;
- Miss out on the opportunity to have a flourishing and strong community of testers on your own company that can provide help and coaching when needed.

That is not all, but from this short list one thing is already apparent: missing out on stuff.

For me as a professional (and a pretty mediocre one comparing to some super testers out there, if you'd ask me) missing out on all of this, says more about you as a tester than you'd think.

You might excel in the contexts you've been at. But you'll never reach your full professional potential. And If I was in a position of recruiting I'd be searching for a tester that, yes, has a personal life, but is always curious enough to try and not miss out on this whole world of experiences that is there for any tester to grasp.

## Then there's zombie testers

Then there's this issue that has been presented by some people before [here]() and [here]() for example.

When you're in a profession that, at least on a local level, like for example, in the city you work at, is made up of a lot of people who don't care, who don't love the craft, guess what: that affects you directly. It's not something that just happens. It has implications:

- You miss out on amazing job opportunities: HR are easy to cheat, other mediocre testers that interview you won't like you and pick on things like "Well you're not smart enough or quick to do math in your head" - and other testers that don't care might get the job because they're easier to find, and willing to do mindless testing or mindless automation of checks (not tests);
- You're left in an environment that won't stimulate you to try and evolve your craft - nobody else is trying - they just sit around and expect to get a raise given they are summing up "years of experience";
- The whole market for our craft gets completely scrambled: tons of people blindly and proudly labeling themselves as "only-manual" testers or "agile" testers or even "only-automation" testers, but the truth is, they are replaceable. Why? Because a good developer with two fingers of forehead can do the same mindless testing they do, and even better. Then, in turn, the market starts believing the nonsense that, hey, after all, we don't need testers - pure rubbish.

## We need testers.

Expert testers. Amazing testers. Not the testers that add as much value as a good unit and mock test suite made by amazing developers. If that's the case, why bother having a tester/QA in your team?

Bear with me, I'm against this idea also. I believe the path is: having both amazing developers that can validate their stuff and having even more amazing testers than can deep test what the developers create and still come up with bugs that were previously unthinkable of finding plus a load of ideas on how to better test the project and even improve the quality of the whole project.

There's another thing: a tester that cares doesn't test only the actual software developed. A tester that cares tests everything: Process, people, project, documents, everything. I'll write more about this on a future post.


In life sometimes we're forced to take paths we like less, that are not our dreams. In the case of testers that's also true. Many of us join the craft but our dreams were something else.
The idea I'd like you to take from this is, follow your dreams. If it's testing, be the best you can be, if it's something else, dedicate and commit yourself to it. There's always time to
follow our passions, even if it is just a tiny bit of our day. Every tiny bit a day will make a big difference over time.

And remember: you can fool everyone, but yourself.
