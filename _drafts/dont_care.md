# "Don't care".

I recently saw a video made by Yegor Bugayenko about A, B and C players on a team. You can watch the same video [here](TODO LINK).

The video reminded me of an issue I've noticed first-hand on my short professional life so far: That people, in particular Testers and QAs don't care.

My "theory" is for every 10 testers out there, maybe only 1 or 2 are actively trying to be better professionals, evolving, going to meetups, conferences, participating in communities, learning from experts like James Back and Michael Bolton. The rest don't care. And sure, we can all excuse ourselves for not caring: work-life balance, my life is so much more, among many other clich√©d responses, but the thing is, they're still excuses. When you have a hobby you love you dedicate a portion of your time to it, and you try to fit that in with everything else in your life. But for many, testing and QA is not a true passion, a true hobby, and a moving force in their lifes. We can discuss if that is good or bad, but I won't digress into that, everyone has their view on it.

The thing I want to digress is: yes, it's true many people don't care. They don't. And they can say all they want but at the end of the day their actions show otherwise.

## Is that bad??

I could digress a lot here, but I'll try to put it on practical terms, that I actually saw happening by experience. Not caring can lead you to:

- Miss out the fact your company can pay you a 1k $ worth training session with a world-renown tester (like James Bach or Michael Bolton, or even Lisa Crispin);
- Miss out the fact your company can pay you another 1k to go to a cool testing conferece where you can, besides watching talks and going to workshops, networking, getting to know other testers and learning from their experiences both in testing and in life;
- Miss out on local meetups and user groups made up of all types of people who you can learn from and share and evolve as a professional;
- Miss out on all possible contacts and future friends that can somehow help you get that dream job at that company you've always been dreaming of;
- Miss out on the opportunity to have a flourishing and strong community of testers on your own company that can provide help and coaching when needed.

That is not all, but from this short list one thing is already apparent: missing out on stuff.

For me as a professional (and a pretty mediocre one comparing to some super testers out there, if you'd ask me) missing out on all of this, says more about you as a tester than you'd think. You might be good in the contexts you've been at. But you'll never reach your full professional potential. And If I was in a position of recruiting I'd be searching for a tester that, yes, has a personal life, but is always curious enough to try and not miss out on this whole world of experiences that is there for any tester to grasp.

## Then there's zombie testers

Then there's this issue that has been talked by some people before [here]() and [here]() for example.

When you're in a profession that, at least on a local level, like for example, in the city you work at, is made up of a lot of people who don't care, who don't love the craft, that affects you. It's not something that just happens. It has implications:

- You miss out on amazing job opportunities: HR are easy to cheat, other mediocre testers that interview you won't like you and pick on things like "Well you're not smart enough or quick to do math in your head" - and other testers that don't care might get the job because they're easier to find, and willing to do monkey testing or monkey automation of checks (not tests);
- You're left in an environment that won't stimulate you to try and evolve your craft - nobody else is trying - they just sit around and expect to get a raise given they are summing up "years of experience";
- The whole market for our craft gets completely trashy: tons of people blindly and proudly labelling themselves as manual testers or agile testers or even automation testers, whatever, but the truth is, they are replaceable. Why? Because a good developer with two fingers of forehead can do the same they do, even better. Then the market starts believing the nonsense that, hey, after all we don't need testers - pure rubish.

We need testers. Expert testers. Amazing testers. Not testers that add as much value as a good unit and mock test suite made by amazing developers. If that's the case, why bother having a QA or a tester in your team?

Bear with me, I'm aggainst this idea also. The path is clear: having both amazing developers that can test their stuff and having even more amazing testers than can deep test what the developers create and still come up with bugs that were previously unthinkable of finding plus a load of ideas on how to better test the project and even improve the quality of the whole project.

There's another thing: a tester that cares doesn't test only the software developed. A tester that cares tests everything. Process, people, project, everything. I'll write more about this on a future post.
