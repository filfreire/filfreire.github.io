## Open-source Contributions

I'm trying to contribute to OSS every day, projects I contributed in a way so far:

- [Tacit](https://github.com/yegor256/tacit) a CSS framework (I'm heavily involved with this one, feel free to submit an Issue/PR).
- [Rultor](https://github.com/yegor256/rultor) a DevOps assistant.
- [OpenTomb](https://github.com/opentomb/OpenTomb) an open-source Tomb Raider 1-5 engine remake.
- [Cactoos](https://github.com/yegor256/cactoos) an Object-oriented Java Primitives library.
- Some minor contributions to [ERDDAP](http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/changes.html) data server for oceanographic data.

I was a reviewer for Yegor Bugayenko's [Software Quality Award, 2017](http://www.yegor256.com/2016/10/23/award-2017.html).
